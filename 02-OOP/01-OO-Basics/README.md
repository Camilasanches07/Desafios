## `01-Define-your-own-class`

A basic challenge to make you code the class of your choice, add some data (i.e. instance variables), a constructor `#initialize` and some behavior (i.e. instance methods)

## `02-Getters-and-Setters`

In this challenge, you must add the right getter/setter instance method to an existing class so that its objects can communicate with the outer world.

## `03-Basic-OOP`

The core challenge of the day, where you have to code an `OrangeTree` class and add lots of behavior, to model its birth, growth, and death :(

## `04-Public-Interface`

A more advanved challenge (optional) in which you should code a `BankAccount` class. You'll have to manipulate different objects (accounts and transaction), and ask yourself philosophical questions about what's a class "interface", its contract with the world!
