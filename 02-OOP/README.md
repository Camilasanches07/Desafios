The OOP module has 6 days.

## `01-OO-Basics` (Wednesday)

You've played with lots of built-in objects in ruby (Fixnum, Hash, Date, etc.). But what about defining your own classes? During this first day you'll learn the notions of class, instance, instance variables and intance methods. You'll also learn about constructor and accessors. Let's build your first classes!

## `02-OO-Advanced` (Thursday)

More advanced OOP concepts, such as inheritance, class methods, and meaning
of the `self` keyword.

## Software architecture (2 days)

### `03-Cookbook-Day-One` (Friday)

We don't define classes only because it's fun.. But also to structure our code and build smart softwares. So let's speak about software architecture and introduce the MVC pattern by coding a to-do manager. Very important morning lecture by your lead-coach! Then you'll work on a cookbook app during 2 days, your first MVC software. Let's start today and sleep on it during the weekend.

### `04-Cookbook-Day-Two` (Monday)

Let's rehearse the MVC pattern during a recap live-code (no slides, just a demo of the lead-coach), and then finish our cookbook app started last Friday. For those of you who've finished early, try to adapt your cookbook manager into a web-app using the Sinatra gem. Ask a teacher to give you a short introduction to Sinatra, so that you have some insights on how to do that.

## Dealing with data models (2 days)

### `05-Food-Delivery-Day-One` (Tuesday)

The morning lecture explains how to deal with several data models in your app. The Food Delivery challenge is a very difficult challenge going through 2 days.

### `06-Food-Delivery-Day-Two` (Wednesday)

Let's start on a recap live-code to help you finish the Food Delivery app today. Then it's your turn. We'll give you the final correction of the Food Delivery challenge at the end of the day at 5pm.

### Quizz

At 2pm on the day of the Food Delivery (Day Two), let's shut down our computers and make a paper quizz during 30 minutes to fix our ideas:
