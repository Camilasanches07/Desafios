## OOP module

The OOP module has 6 days.

### `01-OO-Basics` (Wednesday)

OK you've played with lots of built-in objects in ruby (Fixnum, Hash, Date, etc.). But what about defining your own classes. In this 1st day you'll learn the core notions of class, object, instance variable and intance methods. You'll learn about very standard instance method: constructor and accessors. Let's build your first class!

### `02-OO-Advanced` (Thursday)

More advanced OOP patterns, such as inheritance, class methods, and meaning
of the `self` keyword.

### Software architecture (2 days)

#### `03-Cookbook-Day-One` (Friday)

We don't define classes only because it's fun.. But also to structure our code and build smart softwares. In this 1st day, we'll speak of software architecture and introduce the MVC pattern, coding a to-dos manager. Very important morning talk by the lead-coach! Then you'll work on a cookbook app during 2 days, your first MVC software. Let's begin today on Friday. Then, sleep on it during the weekend.

#### `04-Cookbook-Day-Two` (Monday)

Let's rehearse the MVC pattern in a morning talk live-code (no slides, just a lead-coach demo), and then finish our cookbook MVC app started last Friday. For those of you who've finished early, try to adapt your cookbook manager as a web-app using the Sinatra gem. Form an advanced group and ask a teacher to give you basic introduction to Sinatra.

### Software architecture with data modeling (2 days)

Le cours du jour introduit des notions de gestion de plusieurs modèles dans une application.

L'exercice du jour, Food Delivery, est un exercice difficile qui s'étale également sur deux jours.

OOP Jour 6 (Mercredi Semaine 3)

Pas de cours ce jour, les élèves continuent sur le Food Delivery de la veille.

À 14h, le deuxième quiz est donné. Même principe que le premier pour la correction.
