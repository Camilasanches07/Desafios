The OOP module has 6 days.

## `01-OO-Basics` (Wednesday)

So far, you've played with lots of built-in objects in ruby (Fixnum, Hash, Date, etc.). But what about defining your own classes? During this first day you'll learn to manipulate classes, instances, instance variables and instance methods. You'll also learn about constructors and accessors. Let's build your first classes!

## `02-OO-Advanced` (Thursday)

More advanced OOP concepts, such as inheritance, class methods, and the meaning of the `self` keyword.

## Software architecture (2 days)

### `03-Cookbook-Day-One` (Friday)

We don't just use classes because they are fun :)
They are also key for structuring our code (and therefore building smart software). So let's start with a bit about software architecture and introduce the MVC pattern by coding a to-do manager. **This is a really important morning lecture - don't miss it!** After this, you'll work on a cookbook app for 2 days. Let's start today and sleep on it during the weekend.

### `04-Cookbook-Day-Two` (Monday)

Let's rehearse the MVC pattern during a recap live-code (no slides, just a demo from the lead coach), and then finish the cookbook app you all started on Friday. For the speedy ones who have finished early, try to adapt your cookbook manager into a web-app using the Sinatra gem. (Ask a teacher to give you a short introduction to Sinatra before you start)

## Dealing with data models (2 days)

### `05-Food-Delivery-Day-One` (Tuesday)

The morning lecture explains how to deal with several data models in your app. The Food Delivery challenge is an intense and difficult challenge that will take you 2 days. Stick with it - you can do it!

### `06-Food-Delivery-Day-Two` (Wednesday)

We'll start with a recap live-code to help you finish the Food Delivery app. Then it's your turn.
We'll give you the solution of the Food Delivery challenge at 5pm.

### Quiz

At 2pm on the day of the Food Delivery (Day Two) - it's quiz time again! Again, no passing or failing, just a quick checkpoint to make sure everyone is grasping the key concepts.
