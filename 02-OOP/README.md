The OOP module has 6 days.

## `01-OO-Basics` (Wednesday)

You've played with lots of built-in objects in ruby (Fixnum, Hash, Date, etc.). But what about defining your own classes? During this first day you'll learn the notions of class, instance, instance variable and intance methods. You'll also learn about constructor and accessors. Let's build your first classes!

## `02-OO-Advanced` (Thursday)
More advanced OOP concepts, such as inheritance, class methods, and meaning
of the `self` keyword.

## Software architecture (2 days)

### `03-Cookbook-Day-One` (Friday)

We don't define classes only because it's fun.. But also to structure our code and build smart softwares. In this 1st day, we'll speak of software architecture and introduce the MVC pattern, coding a to-dos manager. Very important morning talk by the lead-coach! Then you'll work on a cookbook app during 2 days, your first MVC software. Let's begin today on Friday. Then, sleep on it during the weekend.

### `04-Cookbook-Day-Two` (Monday)

Let's rehearse the MVC pattern in a morning live-code (no slides, just a demo of the lead-coach), and then let's finish our cookbook MVC app started last Friday. For those of you who've finished early, try to adapt your cookbook manager as a web-app using the Sinatra gem. Create an advanced group and ask a teacher to give you a short introduction to Sinatra.

## Software architecture with data modeling (2 days)

### `03-Cookbook-Day-One` (Tuesday)
The morning lecture explains how to deal with several data models in your app. The Food Delivery challenge is a very difficult challenge goign through 2 days.

### `03-Cookbook-Day-One` (Wednesday)
Let's start on a recap live-code to help you finish the Food Delivery app today. Then it's your turn. We'll give the final correction of the Food Delivery challenge at the end of the day.
