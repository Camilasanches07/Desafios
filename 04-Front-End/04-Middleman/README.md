Reminder, **no live-code tonight as you will pitch your idea in front of the class instead**!

## Evening Pitch session

If you've done your homework ðŸ˜€, you should have uploaded your product pitch [here](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products). You now have 5 minutes to pitch your idea in front of the class in the evening.

## Votes & Team building

- After the pitch session, [you can vote on kitt](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products) for the projects you like most. It will give a first idea of popular projects within the class.
- Then you'll have until Friday to [build teams on kitt](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products) of **3 people**.

On Friday, we will start prototyping your app during a great Product Design Sprint. Teams need to be set up for Friday ðŸ‘ŠðŸ‘ŠðŸ‘Š. Now let's go back to today's challenge!

## `01-Playing-with-ERB`

Play with ERB, add a team page to your Middleman project and import your Airbnb home putting common parts in the layout. Replace `<a>` and `<img>` tags with `<%= link_to %>` and `<%= image_tag %>` helpers.

## `02-Over-ride-Bootstrap`

Define your own graphical variables for fonts and colors in `config/_variables.scss` and use them to over-ride Bootstrap theme. Then import your Airbnb CSS code in your Middleman project and refactor your code in SCSS.

## `03-Flat-dynamic-view`

First create a YAML database for your flats. Then add a dynamic flat template able to display [Romain's flat](https://lewagon.github.io/middleman-airbnb/flats/monsieurpaillard.html), [Boris' flat](https://lewagon.github.io/middleman-airbnb/flats/papillard.html), [Seb's flat](https://lewagon.github.io/middleman-airbnb/flats/ssaunier.html), etc.

## `Optional-01-Blogging-with-Middleman`

Use Middleman [blogging extension](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/) to add a blog to your Airbnb.
