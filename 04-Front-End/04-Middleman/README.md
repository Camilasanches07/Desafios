Reminder, **no live-code tonight as you will pitch your idea in front of the class instead**!

## `01-Playing-with-ERB`

Play with ERB, add a team page to your Middleman project and import your Airbnb home putting common parts in the layout. Replace `<a>` and `<img>` tags with `<%= link_to >` and `<%= image_tag >` helpers.

## `02-Over-ride-Bootstrap`

Define your own graphical variables for fonts and colors in `config/_variables.scss` and use them to over-ride Bootstrap theme. Then import your Airbnb CSS code in your Middleman project and refactor your code in SCSS.

## `03-Flat-dynamic-view`

First create a YAML database for your flats. Then add a dynamic flat template able to display [Romain's flat](http://lewagon.github.io/middleman-airbnb/flats/romain.html), [Anne's flat](http://lewagon.github.io/middleman-airbnb/flats/anne.html), [Seb's flat](http://lewagon.github.io/middleman-airbnb/flats/seb.html), etc..

## `Optional-01-Blogging-with-Middleman`

Use Middleman [blogging extension](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/) to add a blog to your Airbnb.

## Pitch session

Normally (if you've done your homework), you should have uploaded your product pitch [here]([upload your pitch on kitt](http://kitt.lewagon.org/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products/pitches). You now have 5 minutes to pitch your idea in front of the class.

## Votes & Team building

- After the pitch session, [you can vote for the projects you like most on Kitt](http://kitt.lewagon.org/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products/voting). It will give a first idea of popular projects within the class.
- Then you have until Friday to [build teams](http://kitt.lewagon.org/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products/voting) of 3 people.

On Friday, you will start prototyping your app during Product Design Sprint. Teams need to be set up at this stage.
