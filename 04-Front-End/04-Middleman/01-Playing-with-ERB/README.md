## Background & Objectives

Let's play with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), a nice ruby tool to help build **static websites**. You can use it for your personal website or portfolio, or for any freelance frontend project with rich content and design.

The objective of today is to code a static version of Airbnb with a [home page](http://lewagon.github.io/middleman-airbnb/), a [team page](http://lewagon.github.io/middleman-airbnb/team.html), and a [dynamic flat page](http://lewagon.github.io/middleman-airbnb/flats/seb.html) (change `seb` to `romain` in the URL to see it in action).

But first, let's get started with Middleman!

## Middleman setup

### Fork and clone the boilerplate

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/lewagon/frontend-advanced-boilerplate/fork" target="_blank">Fork Le Wagon's Middleman boilerplate</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to <a href="https://github.com/&lt;user.github_nickname&gt;/frontend-advanced-boilerplate/settings" target="_blank">your repo's settings</a> and change the name to <code>airbnb-static</code>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/settings-rename-repo.png">
</div>

Now let's clone the project and install any missing gems:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>
git clone git@github.com:<user.github_nickname>/airbnb-static.git
cd airbnb-static
bundle install
```

This is a new, separate project, so **we don't clone it inside `fullstack-challenges`**.

### Middleman commands

To start a web-server:

```bash
middleman server # launch local server (Ctrl + C to kill it)
```

When you want to build your HTML/CSS code and deploy it with Github Pages, first commit your work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "finished some work"
```

And when your `git status` is clean, deploy your website:

```bash
middleman deploy # deploy website on Github Pages
```

## Home Page

Let's get back our Airbnb home-page (built last Friday) and include it in Middleman. You can find it in the `home-page-html-css` folder of the exercise.

1. Copy the page content in the `index.html.erb` template
1. Add missing SCSS partials in Middleman `components` stylesheets  (e.g. `_banner.scss`, `_card.scss`, `_feature.scss`)
1. Add `_footer.scss` in Middleman `layout` stylesheets. Even if the footer is a component, it's a good practice to put all "layout components" in a separated directory (just to organize the code).

## Footer & Layout

The footer shouldn't just be in the `index.html.erb` template. It's on every page of the website, right?

So, to avoid repeating the footer's code in every template of the project, put it in the `layout.erb` file, i.e. the common skeleton of all templates:

```erb
<!-- layouts/layout.erb -->
<%= partial "navbar" %>   <!-- call _navbar.html.erb partial -->
<%= yield %>              <!-- Page content is injected here -->
<%= partial "footer" %>   <!-- call _footer.html.erb partial -->
```

Then add an ERB partial `_footer.html.erb` with your footer code:

```html
<!-- _footer.erb -->

<div id="footer">
  <!-- Your footer code in here -->
</div>
```

- Using layouts means that all the common parts (navbar, footer, analytics, etc.) **only have to be coded once**.
- ERB partials make our HTML code way more concise and easy to read.

## Team Page

Add a second page `team.html.erb` to your website with your team's members, like [this one](http://lewagon.github.io/middleman-airbnb/team.html). Don't forget to put real pictures of you and your buddy (from the `Classmates` page on Kitt).

Also remember that you are using ERB now, so you can **write ruby to generate HTML code**. It means we can now do awesome stuff like this:

```erb
<ul class="list-inline text-center">
  <% ["boris", "seb", "romain"].each do |member| %>
    <li>
      <%= image_tag "#{member}.png", class: "img-circle" %>
      <h3><%= member.capitalize %></h3>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

That ERB code will generate this HTML code:

```html
<!-- HTML output -->
<ul class="list-inline text-center">
  <li>
    <img src="images/boris.png" alt="">
    <h3>Boris</h3>
  </li>
  <li>
    <img src="images/seb.png" alt="">
    <h3>Seb</h3>
  </li>
  <li>
    <img src="images/romain.png" alt="">
    <h3>Romain</h3>
  </li>
</ul>
```

Awesome right? ðŸ˜²

## Helpers

Helpers are ruby methods that you will use in your templates to generate `<a>`, `<img>`, `<link>`, etc. Most helper methods can be called with an optional hash of attributes (like `class` and `id`). For instance:

```erb
<%= image_tag "example.png", class: "img-rounded avatar" %>
```

Or

```erb
<%= link_to "Meet the team", "team.html", class: "btn btn-primary" %>
```

You can have a look at [Middleman documentation for helpers](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/helper_methods/).

**Your turn to replace all your `<a>` and `<img>` with the right helper methods.**

## Commit and deploy

Now that you have a working Middleman project with a home and a team page, it's time to `commit` your work and `deploy`:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "finished home and team page"
git push origin master
middleman deploy
```
