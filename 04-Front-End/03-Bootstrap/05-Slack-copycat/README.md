## Background & Objectives

Build a [copycat of Slack](https://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/12-Slack/) using the techniques you have learned in this morning's lecture, and previous lectures.

You can choose how to implement this layout, you just have to have the right components (messages, badges, sidebars, and the chat section where you see your messages on slack).
