## Background & Objectives

Build a [profile dashboard](https://lewagon.github.io/layouts-demo/grid-layout.html) like in the Karr lecture. Implement this layout in the `layout/profile.css` file.

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/profile-example.png" alt="" width="100%">
</div>

## Starting the challenge

1. Make sure you understand the code in `index.html` and the design in `components/card.css`.
2. Go back to the Karr lecture to review how to build a layout using **CSS grids**
3. **Don't cheat by inspecting the code! ðŸ”Ž** The goal of this challenge is to teach you how to build a layout by yourself. Take you time to think, ask teachers if you're stuck, but don't cheat ðŸ˜‰!
