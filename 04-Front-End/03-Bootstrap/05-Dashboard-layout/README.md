## Background & Objectives

Build a [profile dashboard](https://lewagon.github.io/layouts-demo/grid-layout.html) like in Karr lecture. Implement this layout in the `layouts/profile.css` file.

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/profile-example.png" alt="" width="100%">
</div>

## Starting the challenge

1. Make sure you understand the code in `index.html`, and the design we give you for cards in `components/card.css`.
2. Go back to Karr lecture to rehearse how you can build a layout using **CSS grid**
3. **Don't cheat and don't inspect the code of our solution!** The goal of this challenge is that you really know how to build a layout by yourself. So take you time to think and raise tickets if you're stuck, but don't cheat ðŸ˜‰!
