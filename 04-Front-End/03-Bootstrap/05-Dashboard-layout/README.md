## Background & Objectives

Build a [profile dashboard](https://lewagon.github.io/layouts-demo/grid-layout.html) like in the Karr lecture. Implement this layout in the `layout/profile.css` file.

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/profile-example.png" alt="" width="100%">
</div>

## Starting the challenge

1. Make sure you understand the code in `index.html` and the design in `components/card.css`.
2. Go back to the Karr lecture to review how to build a layout using **CSS grids**
3. **Don't cheat by inspecting the code! ðŸ”Ž** The goal of this challenge is to teach you how to build a layout by yourself. Take you time to think, ask teachers if you're stuck, but don't cheat ðŸ˜‰!

## Structure the HTML of your grid

Your grid should look like this:

```html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="card main-section">
    <!-- stuff -->
  </div>
  <div class="card stats-section">
    <!-- stuff -->
  </div>
  <div class="card stats-section">
    <!-- stuff -->
  </div>
  <!-- etc ...-->
</div>
```

Here the `.card` class is just to design every grid item with a white background and a nice shadow, then the different classes `.main-section`, `.stats-section`, etc... are here to precisely define the CSS grid behavior of each grid item. Good luck!
