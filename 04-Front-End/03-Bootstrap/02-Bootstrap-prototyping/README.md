## Background & Objectives

Practice using the Bootstrap classes. Prototype the restaurant page of Deliveroo using only bootstrap! (You're not allowed to write any CSS)

## Specs

For this exercise the HTML and the Bootstrap grid is already coded for you on the `index.html`.
All you have to do is add the right Bootstrap class to have the wanted behaviour. For example:

```html
<a href="#" class="">I'm a link!</a>
```

To make this link a button you just have to add the class `btn btn-primary`:

```html
<a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">I'm a button now!</a>
```

## Further suggestions & resources

- Make sure to use the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2), they have a lot more to offer than `btn` classes!
