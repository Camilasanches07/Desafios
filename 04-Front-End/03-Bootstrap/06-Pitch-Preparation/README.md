## Upload your pitch this weekend

**Important Reminder** - you have homework this weekend! On Monday at 5pm, it's Pitch Night, which means you need to [upload your pitch on kitt](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products) on Sunday!

Remember the key points:

- Who is the **target**? Define your customer segment accurately.
- What's the **pain** your product tackles?
- What's the **solution**?

One little incentive: If you are the first to upload ü•á, you get to choose if you pitch first, or last!

For all the information you need about what makes a good pitch, make sure you refer to [Guidelines for Le Wagon's projects](https://github.com/lewagon/product#pitches). This page also has some information on Voting.

## Voting on projects

The [guidelines](https://github.com/lewagon/product#teams) page also has some information on voting.

Once everyone has pitched, you will have 24 hours to vote for your 3Ô∏è‚É£ favourite projects (i.e. **the ones you want to work on!**) You can vote for your own product if you want, but it's not necessary.

**IMPORTANT NOTE!** If you have pitched an idea and have enough votes to form a team, remember that division of labour is crucial. You don't want to pick a team of developers who all want to work on just back-end. Neither do you want a team full of CSS-addicts üòÜ

Try and select a ‚öñÔ∏è _balanced team_ ‚öñÔ∏è whose skills complement each other well. You'll end up with a far more rounded product on Demo Day!
