## Important - Upload your pitch this weekend

You need to [upload your pitch on kitt](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products) this weekend.

Then, next Monday evening, instead of the live-code, you will pitch your idea in front of the class. A good pitch should explain in 5 minutes max and very simply:

- Your **target** (and first customer segment)
- Their **pain** (or need)
- Your **unique value proposition** (or solution)

Here is an example of a good product pitch:

- **target**: fast-food managers
- **pain**: struggle to build plannings and pay employees (big turnover)
- **value proposition**: web-app to handle plannings and generate pay slips

Don't forget to [upload your pitch on kitt](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products) before Monday üôèüôèüôè.

## `01-Smiley-grids`

Play with the grid, learn to build different responsive grids.

## `02-Outer-wrapper-Inner-cards`

An important rule in Bootstrap. **Don't touch directly the CSS of grid elements**. For a background color, first put a wrapper **around** the `.container`. For inner cards, first inject these cards **inside** the `.col`. Then add CSS to wrapper and cards (but not to grid elements).

## `03-Airbnb-without-grid`

Get familiar with Bootstrap CSS classes to build a [first mockup of Airbnb home](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/08-Final-airbnb-home-without-grid/) (without the grid):

- Text and list classes (`.text-center`, `.list-inline`)
- Button classes (`.btn-primary`, `.btn-success`..)
- Form classes (`.form-control`, `.form-group`, `.form-inline`..)

Find **your own set of icons** in one of our design resources.

Let's [finalize Airbnb home](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/09-Final-airbnb-home/index.html) injecting features and flats into 2 Bootstrap grids.

A small challenge but a very important one. Let's learn to build a [simple responsive login form](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/10-Login/login.html) using Bootstrap.
