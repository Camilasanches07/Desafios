## `01-Smiley-grids`
Play with the grid, learn to build different responsive grids.

## `02-Outer-wrapper-Inner-cards`
An important rule in Bootstrap. **Don't touch directly the CSS of grid elements**. For a background color, first put a wrapper around the `.container`. For inner cards, inject these cards into the `.col`. Then you can add CSS to wrapper and cards (but not with grid elements).

## `03-Airbnb-without-grid`
Get familiar with Bootstrap CSS classes to build [Airbnb home 1st version](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/08-Final-airbnb-home-without-grid/) (without grids):

- Text and list classes (`.text-center`, `.list-inline`)
- Button classes (`.btn-primary`, `.btn-success`..)
- Form classes (`.form-control`, `.form-group`, `.form-inline`..)

Find your own set of icons on one of our design resources.

## `04-Airbnb-final-home`
Let's [finalize Airbnb home](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/09-Final-airbnb-home/index.html) injecting features and flat-cards into 2 grids.

## `05-Login`
A small challenge but a very important one. Let's learn to build a [simple responsive login form](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/10-Login/login.html) using Bootstrap.

## `06-Search-form`
Replace your Airbnb banner button by an [inline form with checkin/checkout/number of guests](http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/11-Airbnb-search-form/), like on real Airbnb home.
