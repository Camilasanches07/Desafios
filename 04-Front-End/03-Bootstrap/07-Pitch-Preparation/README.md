## Upload your pitch this weekend

Reminder - you have some homework this weekend and you need to [upload your pitch on kitt](http://kitt.lewagon.org/camps/<user.batch_slug>/products/pitches) this weekend.

Then, next Monday evening (instead of the live-code) you will pitch your idea in front of the class.

## What makes a good product pitch

A good pitch should explain in 5 minutes max and very simply:

- Your **target** (and first customer segment)
- Their **pain** (or need)
- Your **unique value proposition** (or solution)

Here is an example of a good product pitch:

- **target**: fast-food managers
- **pain**: struggle to build plannings and pay employees (big turnover)
- **value proposition**: web-app to handle plannings and generate pay slips
