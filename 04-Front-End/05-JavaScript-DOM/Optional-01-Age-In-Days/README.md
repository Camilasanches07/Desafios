Let's go back to Node.js and `rake`.

## Specs

In `lib/age_in_days.js`, implement the function `ageInDays(day, month, year)` which will return the number of days lived until this very day. You can run `rake` to check your work.

## Further suggestions & resources

You may want to read the [Date documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
on Mozilla Developer Network (the **best** one out here. Do not use the `w3schools` website). **Do not** use external libraries, just pure JavaScript.
