## Your CSS future is bright!

Congratulations for today, it was a very important day in your CSS career. From now on:

- You can directly use [Le Wagon components library](http://lewagon.github.io/ui-components/) without recoding it every time :)
- Remember, always **take time to think about your HTML stucture** (wrapper, container, inside components etc..). It's **90% of the work**. After that, you just have to re-use components and make some small CSS adjustments.

## [Optional] Enhanced profile on Github Pages

For those who have time, let's improve your online profile page (the one you pushed on Github Pages yesterday). You can include the nice profile header you've just coded.

## [Optional] Flexbox froggy

For those who want to practice their flexbox skills, here's a cool [froggy game](http://flexboxfroggy.com/). I love it, because I'm French ;)
