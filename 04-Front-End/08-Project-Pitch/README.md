## Product pitch

From 9h to 9h30, discuss with your coaches what is a good product pitch. A very concise way, in 5 minutes to explain:

- your **target** (and 1st segment)
- their **pain** (or need)
- your **value proposition** (or solution)

Exemple of good product picth from a former student on [Medpics](https://www.medpics.fr/)

- target: interns and doctors
- pain: lack of clinical cases
- value proposition: mobile app to share clinical cases and diagnostics

Take 30 min to prepare it, and then, pitch time!

## Pitch time

From 10h-11h30, your turn to picth:

- 5 min for each team
- Before starting open a google spreadsheet listing all projects in pitch order. During picthes, students should vote for the projects they like in the spreadsheet. This will help start negociations and make teams for the final 2 weeks.

After the picth, your coaches will give you a feedback

- Is your target / pain / value proposition clear?
- Sometimes you want to handle several needs instead of focusing on one issue and finding an awesome solution for that.

## Product afternoon

During the afternoon, you will be taught what is a user story. As an example, choose popular web apps as Uber, Airbnb, Instacart, Product Hunt, etc.. and list their user stories.

- As a user, I can see surounding cars.
- As a user, I can ask for a car with my current location.
- As a user, I can have an estimate of the price with my destination.
- As a user, I can book a car.
- As a driver, I can ...

Then, do the same on your projects

- Your turn to list the user stories of your MVP on a sheet of paper.
- Start drawing the mockup of your different views.
- For the mockup, don't hesitate to use the resources we gave us in frontend lectures to find inspiration. Most of you are not born designers and even great designers have started by copying what works ;)
