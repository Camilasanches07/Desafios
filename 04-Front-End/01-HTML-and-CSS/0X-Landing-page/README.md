## Background & Objectives

Any website has to have a **beautiful landing page**. They are an important as they're the first page visitors will see and it needs to be good enough to convert them into clients üí∞.
In this challenge you will learn how to browse the web for frontend inspiration, and then a professional looking page yourself!

Your landing page should **at least** include:

- A **Hero / Banner** section presenting your product.
- A **How it works** section.
- A **Footer**.

## Find inspiration

Don't blindly jump into coding, the first thing a frontend developer as to do is find inspiration! You're not stealing here, but looking online at what works to reproduce a nice user experience.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never start coding a page without knowing how it will look!**

To find inspiration you can use one of these resources:
- [pages.xyz](https://www.pages.xyz/)
- [Bootstrap themes](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/)

If you haven't found anything online you can use [this page](https://arthur-littm.github.io/startup-landing/) as inspiration.

## Mockup

Next friday you will learn how to mockup your pages like a pro using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), but for today you can use a pen and paper to design the different sections of your page.

If you're designing [this page](https://arthur-littm.github.io/startup-landing/), you should have something like this.

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/startup-landing-drawing.png" alt="" width="100%">
</div>

‚ö†Ô∏è If you're not 100% certain to have the right structure drawn, call a teacher to confirm before starting to code!
