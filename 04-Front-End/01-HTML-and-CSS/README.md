The objective of today is to code your profile page and put it online, like [this example](http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/04-advanced-selectors/). Go Go Go!!

## `01-Profile-content`
Start by manipulating basic HTML tags and adding headers/texts/lists/images/tables to your profile page.

## `02-Fonts-and-colors`
Add simple CSS code to design fonts and colors. A frontend developer always starts by setting the background color for the body and the colors and fonts for texts, headers and links.

## `03-Box-model`
Now play with the box model (`margin/border/padding/width/height`) by splitting your profile information into different `<div>`.

## `04-Advanced-selectors`
Use advanced selectors (id, class, grouping, descendant selectors) to fine-tune your page with a more subtle design.

## `05-Fixed-sidebar`
Build a nice layout with a fixed sidebar and a scrollable page content.

## `06-Push-on-Github-Pages`
Time to put your profile page online using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a cool service of Github.

## `01-Optional-Profile-dashboard`
Create a profile dashboard by inserting your info into a nice 2D layout. You'll
have to use a lot of CSS positioning techniques.

## `02-Optional-Event-form`
A little challenge to manipulate HTML `<form>` and most standard `<input>`.
