The Front-end module has 7 days + 1 project-day to start preparing your final projects.

## `01-HTML-and-CSS` (Wednesday)

You'll cover a lot of HTML & CSS concepts in the next few days, such as:

- HTML skeleton and common tags (in `<head>` and `<body>`)
- CSS simple and advanced selectors
- Web-design resources for fonts & colors (google fonts, fontawesome, etc.)

The objective of this day is to build [your profile page](http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/04-advanced-selectors/) and put it online using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## `02-CSS-components` (Thursday)

We will go a bit further and make you code your own CSS component library. The objectives are:

- Improve the way you organize and store components
- Re-code your [own CSS library](http://lewagon.github.io/ui-components)
- Build pages re-using components, like [Airbnb Home](http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/10-homepage-with-cards/) or [Product Hunt dashboard](http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/12-profile-with-products/)

**Take-away**: Once you've finished, you'll be able to take HTML/CSS code directly from [Le Wagon components](http://lewagon.github.io/ui-components).

## `03-Bootstrap` (Friday)

Before diving into Bootstrap, we will briefly (15 minutes) go over some key design resources & tools you'll be using to build your graphical assets (pictures, icons, colors, fonts).

Then, we will move to Bootstrap.

- For rich components, we've built our own CSS library.
- For standard ones, let's not re-invent the wheel! We'll be using built-in Bootstrap classes.
- Yesterday we saw how to build small grids with flexbox (e.g. for tabs). But for a functional responsive grid, we need something more robust: here comes the [Bootstrap grid](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid)!

## `04-Frontend-Advanced` (Monday)

We'll introduce advanced concepts such as ERB, layout, and SASS. For that, we will use a nice frontend framework called [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and we'll learn to organize our HTML and CSS code in a very DRY way.

It's normal to struggle a bit with Middleman. The good news is: Rails frontend will be very similar to Middleman. So it's a very good investment to work hard on it!

Then, instead of the live-code it's Pitch Night! You will have 5 minutes to pitch your idea in front of the class. [Here's a link](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/93/challenges?path=04-Front-End/03-Bootstrap/06-Pitch-Preparation) if you want a head-start on preparing.

## `05-Javascript-and-jQuery` (Tuesday)

Our morning talk will be an introduction to Javascript and jQuery. We'll look at what js and ruby have in common, and how they differ. Then, we will introduce jQuery ‚Äì an awesome JavaScript library ‚Äì to play with the DOM, define events and callbacks.

## `06-jQuery-plugins` (Wednesday)

Learn how to include a jQuery plugin **the correct way** in your project, either by using a gem or using [Rails-assets](https://rails-assets.org/), and then adding the correct links in your `application.js` and `application.scss` files.

## `07-HTTP-Ajax` (Thursday)

HTTP is **the** protocol on which a website is based and that you absolutely need to know. **So make sure you understand it :)**. Then learn to make HTTP requests in javascript using AJAX. And today is the day when we start playing with APIs! Yeah!

## `08-Product-Design-Sprint` (Friday)

This is a special day. **No coding üò±, just prototyping and Product design üñåüñçüìù**. The objective is to:

- Prototype your project with your team
- Make a demo of your project in front of the class as if you had coded it.
