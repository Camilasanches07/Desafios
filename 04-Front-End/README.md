The Front-end module has 7 days + 1 project-day to start preparing your final projects.

## `01-HTML-and-CSS` (Wednesday)
You will cover most of HTML & CSS concepts :

- HTML skeleton and common tags (in `<head>` and `<body>`)
- CSS simple and advanced selectors
- Web-design resources for fonts & colors (google fonts, fontawesome).

The objective of this day is to build [your profile page](http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/04-advanced-selectors/) and put it online using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## `02-CSS-components` (Thursday)
We will go a bit further and make you code your own CSS component library. The objectives are

- Improve your components culture
- Code your own CSS library
- Build page re-using components

<br>

- **First goal**: code [this CSS components library](http://lewagon.github.io/ui-components)
- **Second goal**: build pages like [Airbnb Home](file:///Users/boris/code/lewagon/html-css-challenges/10-homepage-with-cards/index.html) or [Product Hunt dashboard](file:///Users/boris/code/lewagon/html-css-challenges/12-profile-with-products/index.html) using your components.
- **Take-away**: of course, from this day you can directly use [Le Wagon components library](http://lewagon.github.io/ui-components), but having coded it will make you a lot more efficient.

## `03-Bootstrap` (Friday)

Before speaking of Bootstrap, we will briefly (15 minutes) list design resources, tools and tricks to build your graphical assets (pictures, icons, colors, fonts).

Then, let's move to Bootstrap.

- For custom components, you've built our own CSS library.
- But for standard ones (list-inline, buttons, forms, etc..), let's not re-invent the wheel and use Bootstrap built-in classes.
- Also yesterday, we saw how to build small grids with flexbox (e.g. for tabs). Again for a functional responsive grid, we need something more robust: here comes [Bootstrap grid](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid).


## `04-Frontend-Advanced` (Monday)
We will introduce advanced concepts such as ERB, layout, and SASS. For that, we will use a nice frontend framework called [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and we will learn to organize our HTML and CSS code in a very DRY way.

It's normal if you struggle a bit with Middleman. The good news is: Rails frontend will be very similar to Middleman. So it's a very good investment to work hard on Middleman!

## `05-Javascript-and-jQuery` (Tuesday)
Morning talk is an introduction to Javascript and jQuery. Let's see what's in common between js and ruby, and what's different. Then, we will introduce jQuery – an awesome JavaScript library – to play with the DOM, define events and callbacks.

## `06-jQuery-plugins` (Wednesday)
Learn how to include a jQuery plugin **the correct way** in your project, either using a gem or using [Rails-assets](https://rails-assets.org/), and then adding the correct links in your `application.js` and `application.scss` files.

## `07-HTTP-Ajax` (Thursday)
HTTP is **the** protocol on which a website is based and that you absolutely need to know. **So understand it**. Then learn to make HTTP requests in javascript using AJAX. We'll start playing with APIs today, yeah!

## `08-Project-Day` (Friday)
This is a rather special day. **No code, no challenges, no buddy**. The objective is to:

- Pitch your idea for the final 2-week projects
- Start building teams, or negociating about it :)
- Start defining your products (**user stories**, **first mockups**).

**Disclaimer: This day should be organized by "Product Experts", selected with Paris agreement.**
