The Front-end module has 7 days + 1 project-day to start preparing your final projects.

## `01-HTML-CSS` (Wednesday)
Very dense morning lecture (**about 2h30 long**) where we'll cover most of HTML & CSS concepts :

- HTML skeleton and basic tags (in `<head>` and `<body>`)
- CSS simple and advanced selectors
- Tools and web-design resources for fonts, colors & icons (google fonts, fontawesome).
- Classical layout techniques (fixed/relative/absolute positioning, flexbox)

**Disclaimer: The morning lecture should really be done by a frontend expert.** Plan a break during this lecture in the middle of the 2h30.

## `02-Bootstrap` (Thursday)
Two lectures in the morning (overall a 2h30 talk like yesterday)

- 1st lecture lists design resources, tools and tips to build your graphical assets (pictures, backgrounds, icons, colors, fonts). This lecture also shows you how to play with SVG icons using [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) and change shapes and colors. It's a 30-45 minute talk.
- 2nd lecture is on Bootstrap, this cool CSS/JS library developed by Twitter guys, very powerful to prototype web-applications.

## `03-Frontend-Advanced` (Friday)
We will introduce advanced concepts such as templates, layout, and SASS. For that, we will use a nice frontend framework called [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and learn to organize our stylesheets in differents folders (layout/components/pages). Once again a very dense talk in the morning (2h30).

Middleman may be a bit hard for you at this point as you discover frontend. But trust us, you will be very happy to know it when we come to Rails! Because Rails frontend will work exactly the same way. **Be brave and rehearse your frontend challenges this weekend if you haven't digest all the courses since Wednesday.**

## `04-Javascript-and-jQuery` (Monday)
Morning talk is an introduction to Javascript and jQuery. Let's see what's in common between js and ruby, and what's different. Then, we will introduce jQuery,an awesome JS library to play with the DOM, define events and callbacks.

## `05-Animation-tricks` (Tuesday)
Learn how to include a jQuery plugin **the correct way** in your project, either using a gem or using [Rails-assets](https://rails-assets.org/), and then adding the correct links in your `application.js` and `application.scss` files.

## `06-HTTP-Ajax` (Wednesday)
HTTP is **the** protocol on which a website is based and that you absolutely need to know. **So understand it**. Then learn to make HTTP requests in javascript using AJAX. We'll start playing with APIs today, yeah!

## `07-Javascript-Advanced` (Thursday)
During the morning demo, we'll speak of webhooks, the "opposite of APIs" since you don't call a webhook, it calls you! During the rest of the day, you'll work on more advanced JS challenges such as coding a HTML form validator.

## `08-Project-Day` (Friday)
This is a rather special day. **No code, no challenges, no buddy**. The objective is to:

- Pitch your idea for the final 2-week projects
- Start building teams, or negociating about it :)
- Start defining your products (**user stories**, **first mockups**).

**Disclaimer: This day should be organized by "Product Experts", selected with Paris agreement.**
