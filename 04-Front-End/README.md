The Front-end module has 7 days + 1 final project day.

## `01-HTML-CSS` (Wednesday)
Very dense morning lecture (**about 2h30 long**) where we'll cover most HTML & CSS concepts :

- HTML basic skeleton and tags (for head and body)
- CSS simple and advanced selectors
- Tools and web-design resources for fonts, colors & icons (google fonts, fontawesome, etc..).
- Classical layout techniques (fixed/relative/absolute positioning)

**The morning lecture should really be done by a frontend expert!**. And do yourself a favor planning a break in the middle of this 2h30-long lecture.

## `02-Bootstrap` (Thursday)
Two lectures in the morning (overall a 2h30 talk as yesterday)

- 1st lecture deals with design resources, tools and tips to build ytour graphical assets easily (images, photos, icones, colors, fonts, etc..). This lecture also show you how to play with your SVG icons with [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/). It's a 30-45 minute talk.
- 2nd lecture is on Bootstrap, this cool CSS/JS library developed by Twitter guys, and very powerfull to prototype applications.

## `03-Frontend-Advanced` (Friday)
Let's introduce advanced concepts as templates, layout, and SASS. For that, we will use a nice frontend framework called [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and learn to organize our stylesheets in differents folders (layout/components/pages). Once again a very dense 2h30 talk in the morning.

Middleman may seem a bit hard for you at this point, but you will be so happy to know it when we come to Rails! Because Rails frontend will work exactly the same way. **So be brave and rehearse your frontend challenges during this weekend if you haven't digest all the courses.**

## `04-Javascript-and-jQuery` (Monday)
Morning talk is an introduction to Javascript and jQuery. Let's see what is in common between js and ruby, and what's different. Then, let's introduce jQuery,an awesome JS library to play with the DOM, define events and callbacks.

## `05-Animation-tricks` (Tuesday)
Learn how to include a jQuery plugin **the correct way** in your project, either using a gem or using [Rails assets](https://rails-assets.org/), and then adding correct links in your `application.js` and `application.scss` files.

## `06-HTTP-Ajax` (Wednesday)
HTTP is the protocol on which is based a website. So understand it. Then learn how to make HTTP requests in javascript using AJAX requests. We'll start playing with APIs today, yeah!

## `07-Javascript-Advanced` (Thursday)
During the morning demo, we'll speak of webhooks, the "opposite of APIs" since you don't call it, it calls you! During the day, you'll work on more advanced JS challenges such as coding HTML form dynamic validation.

## `08-Project-Day` (Friday)
This is a rather special day. **No code, no challenges, no buddy**.

This day is here to:

- Pitch your idea for the final 2-week projects
- Start building teams, or negociating about it :)
- Start defining your products (**user stories**, **first mockups**).

This day should be organized by "Product Experts", selected with Paris agreement.
