## The core journey

Every popular app has **one user journey** at the heart of the product. For Airbnb, it's the user journey of someone who wants to book a flat:

A good user journey should have 5 views max. We will not accept projects with more than 5 views ðŸ˜‡. So, **what's your core user journey?**

## Action, context, angle

For **each view**, fill in the following grid:

This will really help you build a clear mockup. Remember:

- Only display enough info to make the user understand what you want them to do**.
- Ask your user to do one thing for each page (e.g. **only one call-to-action in each view**).

## Your turn, use post-its!

Grab some post-its and work on your core journey with your team! ðŸ›«
