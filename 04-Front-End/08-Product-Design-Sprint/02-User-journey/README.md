## The core journey

Every popular app has **one user journey** at the heart of the product. For Airbnb, it's the user journey to book a flat:

A good user journey should have 5 views max. We will not accept projects with more than that! *What's your user journey?*

## Action/Context/angle for each view

For each view of this journey try to complete the following grid:

Doing this work will help you a lot to build a clear mockup. Remember:

- Just display the info **necessary to make the user understand what you want him/her to do**.
- Just ask your user to do one thing for each page (which translates into only one call-to-action in each view).
