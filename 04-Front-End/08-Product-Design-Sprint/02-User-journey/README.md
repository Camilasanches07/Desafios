## The core journey

Every popular app has **one user journey** at the heart of the product. For Airbnb, it's the user journey to book a flat:

A good user journey should have 5 views max. We will not accept projects with more than 5 views ðŸ˜‡. So, **what's your core user journey?**

## Action, context, angle

For **each view** of this journey try to complete the following grid:

This work will help you a lot to build a clear mockup. Remember:

- Just display the info **necessary to make the user understand what you want him/her to do**.
- Just ask your user to do one thing for each page (e.g. **only one call-to-action in each view**).

## Your turn, use post-its!

Grab some post-its and work on your core journey with your team!
