## Background & Objectives

Once your core journey is well-defined, and once you have figured out the zoning of each page, it's time to build an actual mockup!

On Mac, you can [download a free trial of Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). For groups that are full Linux, have a look at
[Gravit](https://gravit.io/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

We recommend Sketch, but since the objective is just to build a PNG for each page of the user journey, feel free a different tool if you really want (Powerpoint, balsamiq, etc):

## Sketch tutorial

Here is a 15min tutorial for Sketch. It should give you enough knowledge to build your mockups.
