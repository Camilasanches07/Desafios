## Background & Objectives

Once your core journey is well defined, and once you have worked on the zoning of each page, it's time to build an actual mockup.

On Mac, you can [download a free trial of Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). For groups that are full Linux, have a look at
[Gravit](https://gravit.io/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

The objective is to build a PNG for each page of the user journey, so you can also use a different tool if you are more familiar with it (Powerpoint, balsamiq, other):

## Sketch tutorial

Here is a 15 minutes tutorial for Sketch. It should be enough to work on your mockup.
