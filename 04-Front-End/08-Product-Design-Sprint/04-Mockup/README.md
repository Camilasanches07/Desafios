## Background & Objectives

Once your core journey is well defined, and once you have worked on the zoning of each page, it's time to build an actual mockup.

There **must** be one Mac user in each team üôè! In this case, he/she can [download the free trial of Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).

The objective is to build a PNG for each page of the user journey, so you can definitely use a different tool if you are more familiar with it:

Here is a 15 minutes tutorial for Sketch. It should be enough to work on your mockup.
