## Use Case = **Verb + Thing**

You have already worked on your **Product Pitch** (defining your target / pain / solution). To design a product, it's very useful to rephrase this pitch as a simple use case with **a verb + a thing**, like for these services you all know:

**What's your use case?** Take your time, discuss with your team and come up with a simple **verb + thing**.

## What's your new angle?

You order a cab on Uber and you book a flat on Airbnb, but those things aren't unique are they? You can order cabs and book flats on lots of apps - it's a shared use case. **But every company has a unique angle**. Let's take a bunch of projects from Le Wagon's former students and define their use case and angle:

1. **Treatout**:
  - `use case`: find a restaurant
  - `angle`: depending on your food allergies
2. **Kudoz**:
  - `use case`: find a job that fits you
  - `angle`: no more CV updates, just connect with Linkedin and accept or decline offers
3. **Skello**:
  - `use case`: manage your planning
  - `angle`: for your restaurant employees and generate their pay slips
4. **Take Away Trips**
  - `use case`: share a custom travel guide
  - `angle`: in only a few clicks
5. **Dinja**
  - `use case`: cook your meals for the week
  - `angle`: by buying exactly what's needed for nice recipes
6. **Happy Papi**
  - `use case`: order a cab
  - `angle`: with a text message!

So you have a clear use case. First step is done. Now **what's your new angle?**
