## Use case = verb + complement

You have already worked on your **Product Pitch** (defining your target / pain / solution). To design a product, it's very useful to rephrase this pitch as a simple use case with **a verb + a complement**, like for these services you all know:

**What's your use case?** Take your time, discuss with your team and come up with a simple **verb + complement**.

## What's your new angle?

Even if you order a cab on Uber or book a flat on Airbnb, these apps are different from other services apparently answering to the same use case. **They have a unique angle**. Let's take a bunch of projects from Le Wagon's former students and define their use case and angle:

1. **Treatout**:
  - `use case`: find a restaurant
  - `angle`: depending on your food allergies
2. **Kudoz**:
  - `use case`: find a job that fits you
  - `angle`: no more CV updates, just connect with Linkedin and accept or decline offers
3. **Skello**:
  - `use case`: manage your plannings
  - `angle`: for your restaurant employees and generate their pay slips
4. **Take Away Trips**
  - `use case`: share a custom travel guide
  - `angle`: in only a few clicks
5. **Dinja**
  - `use case`: cook your meals for the week
  - `angle`: by buying online what's needed for nice recipes
6. **Happy Papi**
  - `use case`: order a cab
  - `angle`: with a text message!

OK you have a clear use case, now **what's your new angle?**
