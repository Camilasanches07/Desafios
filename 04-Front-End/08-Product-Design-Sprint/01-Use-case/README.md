## Use case = verb + complement

You have already worked on your Product Pitch defining your target, their pain and your unique value proposition. To design a product, it's very useful to rephrase this pitch as a simple use case with **verb + complement**, like for these services you know:

**What's your use case?** Take your time, discuss with your team and come up with a simple **verb + complement**.

## What's your new angle?

Even if you order a cab on Uber, or book a flat on Airbnb, these apps are different from similar services apparently answering to the same use case. **They have a unique angle**.

Let's take some projects from Le Wagon alumni and define their use case and angle:

1. **Treatout**:
  - `use case`: find a restaurant
  - `angle`: depending on your food allergies
2. **Kudoz**:
  - `use case`: find a job
  - `angle`: don't update CV, and just accept / decline offers
3. **Skello**:
  - `use case`: manage your plannings
  - `angle`: for your restaurant employees and generate their pay slips
4. **Take Away Trips**
  - `use case`:
5. **Dinja**
  - `use case`: cook your meals
  - `angle`: buy online what's needed for cool recipes
6. **Happy Papi**
  - `use case`: order a cab
  - `angle`: with a text message!

OK you have a clear use case, now **what's your new angle?**
