## `01-Use-case`

Define your app use case in a very clear way, e.g. **verb + complement**, and find the angle that makes you different.

## `02-User-journey`

There is always **one** user journey at the heart of a product. For Airbnb, it's the user journey to book a flat. **What about yours?**

To kill frictions, a good journey should have 5 views max, no more (**this is mandatory!**).

For each page, what do you want your user to do? How he/she is supposed to understand that, depending on the info you display?

## `03-Zoning`

Time to draw rectangles for each page of your journey. You can use Keynote, Sketch, or simply sheets of paper.

## `04-Mockup`

Once your core journey is well defined, and once you have worked on the zoning of each page, it's time to build an actual mockup.

There must be one Mac user in each team üôè! So you can [download the free trial of Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and watch our [15 minutes Sketch tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR-6RW3kHyM). It should be enough to work on your mockup.

## `05-Prototype`

When you have finished your Sketch mockup (and validated it with a teacher), you can now export each page as a PNG and build a prototype on [marvelapp](https://marvelapp.com/) by connecting the views.

Again, you can watch [our quick marvelapp tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFIlW68giDY).

## Demo

At the end of the day, each team will make a demo of its prototype in front of the class. When making your demo, **try to impersonate a real user** and tell us a story!
