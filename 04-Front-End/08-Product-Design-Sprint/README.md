## `01-Use-case`

Define your app's use case in a very clear way, e.g. **verb + complement**, and find the angle that makes you different.

## `02-User-journey`

There is always **one core user journey** at the heart of a product. For Airbnb, it's the user journey to book a flat. **What about yours?** To kill frictions, a good journey should have 5 views max, **no more**.

For each page of your journey, what do you want your user to do? How is he/she supposed to understand that? **Let's detail a bit your core journey with post-its**.

## `03-Zoning`

Time to draw rectangles to organize the info you display on each page. You can use Keynote, Sketch, or simply sheets of paper 😁.

## `04-Mockup`

Once your core journey is defined, and once you have worked on the zoning of each page, it's time to build an actual mockup.

If there is one Mac user in your team (let's pray 🙏🙏🙏), he/she can [download the free trial of Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and watch our [15 minutes Sketch tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR-6RW3kHyM). If not, just use another tool you are familiar with (powerpoint, balsamiq, other). It should be enough to build a decent mockup.

## `05-Prototype`

Once you have finished your mockup (and validated it with a teacher), you can now export each page as a PNG and build a prototype on [marvelapp](https://marvelapp.com/) by connecting the views. This time, Marvelapp is a web application (with a free plan) so everyone can use it!

Again, you can watch [our quick Marvelapp tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFIlW68giDY).

## Demo

At the end of the day, each team will make a demo of its prototype in front of the class. When making your demo, **try to impersonate a real user** and tell us a story!
