## `01-Use-case`

Define your product's use case in a very clear way (**verb + complement**) and find the angle that makes you different.

## `02-User-journey`

There is always **one** user journey at the heart of a product. For Airbnb, it's the user journey to book a flat. **What about your core user journey?**. To kill a maximum of frictions, your user journey should have less than 5 views (**this is mandatory**).

For each view, define what you want your user to do, and how he/she is supposed to understand that depending on the info you display on the page.

## `03-Zoning`

Time to draw rectangles for each view of your user journey. You can use Keynote, Sketch, or simply sheets of paper.

## `04-Mockup`

Once your core journey is well defined, and once you have worked on the zoning of each page of this journey, it's time to build an actual mockup.

We are sure there is a Mac user in every team :) so you can [download the free trial of Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and watch our [15 minutes Sketch tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR-6RW3kHyM) to be able to work on your mockup.

## `05-Prototype`

When you have finished your Sketch mockup (and validated it with a teacher or TA), you can export each page as a PNG and build a prototype on [marvelapp](https://marvelapp.com/) by connecting the views. Again, you can watch [our quick marvelapp tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFIlW68giDY).

## Demo

At the end of the day, each team will make a demo of its prototype in front of the class. When making your demo, **try to impersonate a real user**.
