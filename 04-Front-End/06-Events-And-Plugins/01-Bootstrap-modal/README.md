## Background & Objectives

In this challenge, learn to insert Bootstrap modals on a sign-up example. Don't spend too much time on this challenge, it's pretty much a copy/paste exercise. All you need to understand is how the button and form are linked through the `data-target` and `id` HTML attributes. Once you've got it, move on to the next challenge.

To complete this exercise, have a read the [Modal Documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals).

As usual, you can:

```bash
serve
```

and check your work in [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).
