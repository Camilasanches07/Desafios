## Background & Objectives

In this challenge, learn to insert Bootstrap modals on a sign-up example. Don't spend too much time on this challenge, this is pretty much a copy/paste exercise. Just understand how the button and form are linked through `data-target` and `id` HTML attributes, then move on to the next challenge.

cf. [Modal Documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals)

As usual, you can:

```html
$ serve
```
