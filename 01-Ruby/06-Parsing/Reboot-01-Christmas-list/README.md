## Guidelines

Winter is coming ‚õÑ‚õÑ‚õÑ. We want to build a program to handle our gifts list, mark items as bought when we've found them and eventually find some inspiration from an external website like Etsy. This challenge should take you all day. üéÅ

As with yesterday, start off by writing the pseudo-code in the group as a live-code üíª.

## Setup

Let's create a folder for this new challenge:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/reboot
mkdir christmas-list
cd christmas-list
touch interface.rb
```

## Pseudo-code

First things first, let's brainstorm the **pseudo-code** together:

```ruby
# interface.rb

# Pseudo-code:
# 1. Welcome
# 2. Display menu (list / add / delete / mark )
# 3. Get user action
# 4. Perform the right action
```

## Step 1 - The menu loop üéÅ

Start by building the main loop displaying action menu and getting user's input:

```bash
ruby interface.rb
> Welcome to your Christmas giftlist
> Which action [list|add|delete|quit]?
> list
> TODO: list items
> Which action [list|add|delete|quit]?
> add
> TODO: ask user an item and add it to giftlist
> Which action [list|add|delete|quit]?
> add
> TODO: ask user the index of item to delete and delete it
> Which action [list|add|delete|quit]?
> quit
> Goodbye
```

## Step 2 - List, Add, Delete üéÅüéÅ

Now let's implement the simple actions (`list`, `add`, `delete`).

- How do you model your `giftlist`?
- Do you use a hash? An array?

**Discuss that with your teacher before you start each action.**

## Step 3 - Mark an item as bought üéÅüéÅüéÅ

We want to be able to mark any item as bought:

```bash
ruby interface.rb
> Welcome to your Christmas giftlist
> Which action [list|add|delete|mark|quit]?
> list
> 1 - [ ] sockets
> 2 - [X] ruby book
> 3 - [ ] macbook pro
> Which action [list|add|delete|mark|quit]?
> mark
> Which item have you bought (give the index)?
> 3
> Which action [list|add|delete|mark|quit]?
> list
> 1 - [ ] sockets
> 2 - [X] ruby book
> 3 - [X] macbook pro
```

- How do you modify your `giftlist` to store the `status` of each item?
- How does it affect your code?

Again, **discuss with your teacher**

## Step 4 - Find ideas on Etsy üéÅüéÅüéÅüéÅ

You are out of ideas for Christmas and you want to find inspiration from [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com).
Add a new action `idea` to your menu (additionally to the `list`, `add`, `delete` and `mark` actions). Here is how this action could work:

```bash
What are you looking for on Etsy?
> Jeans
Here are Etsy results for "Jeans":
1 - Levis Blue Jeans
2 - Vintage Jeans
3 - Cargo Jeans Pants
4 - White Jeans
etc.
Pick one to add to your list (give the number)
> 2
"Vintage Jeans" added to your wishlist
```

For the scraper, here is a starting script to help you extract the data:

```ruby
# scraping_etsy.rb
require "open-uri"
require "nokogiri"

puts "What are you searching on Etsy?"
article = gets.chomp

# 1. We get the HTML file thanks to open-uri
file = open("https://www.etsy.com/search?q=#{article}")

# 2. We build a Nokogiri document from this file
doc = Nokogiri::HTML(file)

# 3. We search every elements with class="card" in our HTML doc

doc.search(".card").each do |card|
  # 4. for each element found, we extract its title and print it
  title = card.search(".card-title").text.strip
  puts title
end
```

- Feel free to scrape another website adapting this script.
- Also, you can scrape other information than just the name (for example the price of the item).
