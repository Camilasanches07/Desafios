## Background & Objectives

### Return your buddy's name

Open the `lib/buddy.rb`. Make sure that the method `today_my_buddys_github_nickname_is` does **return** (this is different to **puts**!) the github username of your buddy. It should return a `String`! If you don't have a buddy, just return your own github username.
