## Ruby-basics module

The Ruby-basics module has 6 days. The first 4 days deal with core notions you absolutely need to understand.

- `01-Programming-basics`: learn how to play with IRB, launch a ruby script from terminal. Learn about variables, methods, built-in objects.
- `02-Flow-Array`: Learn about conditional statements and loops, coding structures that modify the flow of your program. Learn how to define and manipulate ruby arrays.
- `03-Iterators-Blocks`: Discover all the cool iterators you can use on arrays, and understand what's a ruby block and how a method can call a block with `yield`.
- `04-Hash-Symbols`: Finally learn about hashes, data stuctures that are more adpated than arrays to store keys-values. Learn to define and manipulate hashes, to iterate on them. Understand symbols, these cousins of strings used for "keywords", often used for hash keys.

The two last days of the Ruby module deal with more advanced stuff.

- `05-Regular-Expressions`: Play with these new objects representing string patterns.
- `04-Parsing`: Learn to read/write standard data-files such as CSV and JSON, and play with your first API.

For these last two days, every student should listen to the morning talk. For the rest of the day, the class should split between:

- A "Reboot" group who will rehearse core notions on new challenges (variables/methods/arrays/hashes/iterators).
- An Advanced group who will work on usual kitt challenges (on regexp and parsing).

If you're not 200% confident with core notions, join the Reboot group! No shame about it, the Reboot is a buffer to rehearse what really matters to perform in the rest of 9 weeks.
