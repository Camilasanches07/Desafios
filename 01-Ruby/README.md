## Ruby module

The Ruby module has 6 days. The first 4 days deal with core notions you absolutely need to understand.

- `01-Programming-basics`: play with IRB, launch a ruby script from the terminal. Learn about variables, methods and built-in objects.
- `02-Flow-Array`: Learn about conditional statements and loops, coding structures that modify the flow of your programs. Define and play with arrays.
- `03-Iterators-Blocks`: Embrace all the cool ruby iterators (`each`, `select`, `map` and more-. Understand what's a ruby block and how a method can call a block with `yield`.
- `04-Hash-Symbols`: Finally let's introduce hashes, data stuctures designed to store key-value pairs like dictionaries. Define and manipulate your own hashes. Understand symbols, objects a bit similar to strings but more adpated for storing "keywords" of your code. You'll often see symbols as hash keys, so get used to it!

The two last days of the Ruby module deal with more advanced stuff.

- `05-Regular-Expressions`: Play with these new objects representing "string patterns".
- `04-Parsing`: Learn to read/write in standard data-files such as CSV and JSON, and play with your first API.

The last two days are not mandatory. Every student should at least listen to the morning talk. But after that, the class should split between:

- A "Reboot" group who will rehearse core notions on new challenges (ex: variables/methods/arrays/hashes/iterators).
- An Advanced group who will keep on working on kitt challenges about regexp and parsing.

If you're not 200% confident with core notions, join the Reboot group! No shame about it, the Reboot is a buffer to rehearse what really matters for the rest of the bootcamp.
