## Ruby module

The Ruby module has 6 days. The first 4 days deal with core notions you absolutely need to understand.

## Core part

- `01-Programming-basics`: play with IRB, launch a ruby script from the terminal. Learn about variables, methods and built-in objects.
- `02-Flow-Array`: Learn about conditional statements and loops, coding structures that modify the flow of your programs. Define and play with arrays.
- `03-Iterators-Blocks`: Embrace all the cool ruby iterators (`each`, `select`, `map` and more-. Understand what's a ruby block and how a method can call a block with `yield`.
- `04-Hash-Symbols`: Finally let's introduce hashes, data stuctures designed to store key-value pairs like dictionaries. Define and manipulate your own hashes. Understand symbols, objects a bit similar to strings but more adpated for storing "keywords" of your code. You'll often see symbols as hash keys, so get used to it!

### Ruby Quizz
On Friday afternoon, at 2pm you'll have to answer a paper quizz during 30 min. No computer, no Google, just pencil and paper. It's not highschool and you wont have grades :) But it's very useful to detect and get rid of your misunderstandings on important notions. So take your time and try to answer as precisely as you can.

When quizz are finished, teachers will take you one-by-one during 15-min reviews to go through your answers and try to re-explain things. This interview will help you know what to rehearse during the weekend and whether or not you should join the Reboot group next Monday-Tuesday (see next section).

## Advanced part

The two last days of the Ruby module deal with more advanced stuff.

- `05-Regular-Expressions`: Play with these new objects representing "string patterns".
- `04-Parsing`: Learn to read/write in standard data-files such as CSV and JSON, and play with your first API.

The last two days are not mandatory. Every student should at least listen to the morning talk. But after that, the class should split between:

- A "Reboot" group who will rehearse core notions on new challenges (ex: variables/methods/arrays/hashes/iterators).
- An Advanced group who will keep on working on kitt challenges about regexp and parsing.

If you're not 200% confident with core notions, join the Reboot group! No shame about it, the Reboot is a buffer to rehearse what really matters for the rest of the bootcamp.
