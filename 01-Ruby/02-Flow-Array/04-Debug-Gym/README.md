## Background & Objectives

Only one lesson to learn from this exercise: **READ THE ERROR**! The message will tell you:

- what kind of error you have
- the line where it occurs in your program

## Specs

Just run

```bash
rake
```

the code in "bugged_concatenate.rb" has a few errors. Try to fix them by reading the messages in the terminal.
