## Re-what? Reboot!

Regular expressions are advanced structures. Don't work on the Regexp challenges unless you are completely clear on the following concepts:

- variable, assignment, re-assignment
- methods, arguments, return (and difference between `return` and `puts`)
- array manipulation and use of iterators (`each`, `map`, `select`..)
- hash manipulation
- strings and symbols

If these concepts are not clear for you, **join the "ReBoot" group, who will work during 2 days on new challenges to rehearse core notions**. For the others, here is the roadmap of the day.

## `01-Phone-regexp`
A simple challenge on regexp to detect phone patterns.

## `02-Anagrams`
This challenge makes a small use of Regexp to detect "non-word" characters but this is not a pure "regexp challenge". You will mainly learn about the notion of time-complexity and try to enhance a program detecting anagrams.

## `03-Mail-spotter`
A simple challenge on email Regexp, very useful in web apps.

## `04-Word-frequency`
A challenge using Regexp to extract data from a text and compute the most frequent words in a given text (the Bible, Obama's inaugural address, etc..). You will have to filter stop-words like ("a", "the", "is"..) who will spoil your algorithm otherwise.
