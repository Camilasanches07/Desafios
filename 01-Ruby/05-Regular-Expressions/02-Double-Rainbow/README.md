## Specs

So, what colors are the logos? The information have been hidden in sentences, by our best secret agents. Your mission is to build regex to reveal the tricks!

Open `lib/double_rainbow.rb` where a series of functions await you!

- Follow hints and instructions to **return a string**
- **Use a regex** to extract that string from the `sentence` variable

You can test your regex in [Rubular](http://rubular.com/)
