## Guidelines

This challenge should take you **45 minutes 🕒**.

1. Just like the first exercise, start by writing the pseudo-code with the teacher as a live-code 💻.
2. Spend 20 minutes on your own to try to figure out the solution.
3. Then let's correct it together! 💻

## Pseudo-code

How should your program work when you launch it? Write the pseudo code!

```ruby
# interface.rb

# Pseudo-code:
# 1. Print welcome
# 2. Get user's bet
# 3. Run the race 🐴
# 4. Print results
```

Each step above is too general, so **try to build it out in a bit more detail**.

## Step 1 - Dumb horse race

The aim is to model a horse race. The user can bet on a horse and he should know if he won after the horses has raced. Let's start with the pseudo code. How are we going to model the horses?

## Setp 2 - Let's add winnings

What would you change if you wanted to add a balance and winnings for the race (let's say you win 50 if you place the correct bet and lost 10 if you lost)? Can I still play if I don't have enough in my balance?
