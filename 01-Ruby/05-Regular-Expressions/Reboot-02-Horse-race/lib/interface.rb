# TODO: you can build your horse race program here!
# Step 1 - Dumb horse race
# Let’s model a horse race. The user can bet on (choose) a horse, the horses run the race (the computer randomly selects a winner), and the winner is printed out in the terminal with a message telling the user if she/he won. Let’s start with the pseudo code. How are we going to model the horses?

# PSEUDOCODE:

# 1. Greet the user
# 2. Create the array of horses
# 3. Display the list of horses with a number
# 4. Ask the user to choose a horse -> choosing a number
# 5. Store the user's choice into a variable -> it's a number
# 6. Choose a random winner from the horses
# 7. Compare the winning horse with the user's choice -> index numbers
# 8. Based on that, we output whether the user won or lost
