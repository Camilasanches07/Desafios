## `01-Enumerable`
- The important challenge of the day. It may take you the all morning.
- **You have to find the right iterator to perform the right operation on an array, and learn how this iterator works**. You'll need to use and read the Ruby docs to finish this challenge succesfully. So read the challenge, find the method you need to use on the docs and discuss with your buddy how you can implement this. Tips: if you pick the right method, no need to write 10 lines of code for each solution!


## `02-About-blocks`
A difficult challenge where you have to code a method generating HTML. This method is different from the ones you've already coded as it can be called with a ruby block. We've added extra difficuty in the challenge introducing a default value for the second argument `tag(tag_name, attr = nil)`. Don't panic with this syntax and read all the challenge & resources carefully. You'll need to use `yield` to finish this challenge successfully, but this will help you understand it better. So if you're still a bit lost right now how yield works, it will become more clear when you're doing this challenge.


## `03-Splitter`
Here you'll combine array methods with blocks!

## `04-Cleaning-your-mess`
These challenges are a bit like one you did earlier this week, basicaly you need to make the code more readable / cleaner.

## `05-Louchebem`
First of all you're going to want to read [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louch%C3%A9bem) on Wikipedia about Louchebem. It is a Parisian butcher's dialect and apparently even today still used among the ones that work in the meat retail industry. What the challenge is about is that you put a normal sentence in and that the method returns a louchebimified sentence.

Good luck today!

PS: don't forget to push your code to github. Do it after every challenge.
