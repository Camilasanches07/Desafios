## `01-Enumerable`

- The important challenge of the day. It may take you all morning.
- **You have to find the right iterator to perform the right operation on an array, and learn how this iterator works**. You'll need to use and read the Ruby docs to finish this challenge succesfully. And if you pick the right method in ruby, no need to write 10 lines of code, 1 is often enough!

## `02-About-blocks`

A difficult challenge where you have to code a method generating HTML. This method is different from the ones you're used to because it can be called with a block. Don't panic with this syntax and read all the challenge & resources carefully. You'll need to use `yield` to finish the challenge successfully. This will help you understand it better. So if you're still a bit lost right now on how yield works, it will become clearer when you're doing this challenge.

## `03-Splitter`

Here you'll combine array methods with blocks!

## `04-Cleaning-your-mess`

This challenges is a bit like ones you did earlier this week, basicaly you need to make the code more readable / cleaner.

## `05-Louchebem`

First of all you're going to want to read [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louch%C3%A9bem) on Wikipedia about Louchebem. It is a Parisian butcher's slang language and apparently even today still used in the meat retail industry. You'll have to build a program that translates sentences into Louchebem slang.

Good luck today!

PS: don't forget to push your code to github. Do it after every challenge.
