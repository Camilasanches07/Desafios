## Quizz

Don't forget, at 2pm you'll have to answer a paper quizz during 30 min. No computer, no Google, just pencil and paper. It's not highschool and you won't receive grades ðŸ˜Š But it's very useful to detect what you get wrong and to get rid of your misunderstandings. So take your time and try to answer as precisely as you can.

ðŸ‘‰ [Quizz #1](https://github.com/lewagon/quizzes/raw/master/pdf/quizz-1.en.pdf)

When quizz are finished, teachers will take you one-by-one during 15-min reviews to go through your answers and try to re-explain things. This interview will help you know what to rehearse during this weekend and whether or not you should join the Reboot group next Monday-Tuesday. Happy quizz!

## `01-Modeling-with-Hash`

The important challenge of the day. Implement methods counting the number of calories in a McDonald order, making use of hashes of course!

## `02-On-symbols`

An original challenge to make you think about symbols and strings. You will have to implement some "quizz methods". Each time you hesitate between a string and a symbol, ask yourself: is it more like a "tag" for my code? or text-data (e.g. user input)?

## `03-Argument-order-dependency`

In this challenge, you have to re-implement a method `refrain` using a hash argument to break the argument order dependency. We will use a lot of methods taking a hash of options as a last argument in Rails.

## `04-Array-to-hash`

A brief challenge to implement a method transforming arrays into hashes with indexed keys. This challenge is optional. Don't do it if your don't feel comfortable with hashes and symbols.
