## Background & Objectives

Let's say you want to stay fit but keep eating McDonalds... You have the brilliant idea to write a quick function that computes the number of calories in a McDonald order. We consider the following products (with their respective number of calories).

- "Cheese Burger" : 290
- "Big Mac" : 300
- "Mc Bacon" : 400
- "Royal Cheese" : 130
- "French fries" : 130
- "Potatoes" : 130
- "Coca" : 160
- "Sprite" : 170

You may store this information in a ruby [constant](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax/Variables_and_Constants#Constants) and treat it as your database.
For instance, you could have a database about students:

```ruby
STUDENTS_WITH_AGE = {
  "Peter" => 21,
  "George" => 22,
  "Mary" => 20
}
```

Read the documentation about [Hash](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html).
They will be your best friends and you'll use them a lot!
As you see, `Hash`es are unordered data structured where data is indexed by **unique** keys,
whereas `Array`s are ordered data structures where elements are retrieved by index (`0`, `1`, `2`...)

**Use `String`s as hash keys, not `Symbol`, for simplicity's sake**

## Specs

- Implement `poor_calories_counter` that return the number of calories for the three courses of your order.
- **constraint**: your method should make use of a hash of course !
- **constraint**: your method should use **our given numbers of calories** !


Now let's say you want to enhance your calories counter, so that he can accepts indifferently a list of beverage, burgers, sides, **and MEALS**. Here are the 3 only meals we will impose:

- `"Happy Meal"` -> "Cheese Burger", "French fries", "Coca"
- `"Best Of Big Mac"` -> "Big Mac", "French fries", "Coca"
- `"Best Of Royal Cheese"` -> "Royal Cheese", "Potatoes", "Sprite"

You may want to store these meals in another constant. Don't try to pre-compute
the calories for each meal, just store which dishes compose a meal.

Enhance your method `#calories_counter` so that you can calculate calories running

```ruby
orders = ["French fries", "Happy Meal", "Sprite"]
puts calories_counter(orders)
```

## Key learning points

- What's a hash ? When do you use them ?
- Can you figure out how you would have done to code your calories counter using arrays ? painfull, no ?
