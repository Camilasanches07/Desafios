The DB & ActiveRecord module has 4 days.

## `01-DB-Design-and-SQL` (Thursday)

Let's learn about relational database, discover the different relationships between tables (`1:n`, `n:n`) and how to **draw** a database scheme. Then, we'll speak of SQL, this language to make queries to our database structured with keywords (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `JOIN` etc..). We will start with simple "read queries" (`SELECT`) during this first day.

## `02-SQL-CRUD` (Friday)

Second day of SQL. You'll discover the concept of CRUD, and you will learn to write in the DB using new SQL keywords (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

## `03-Active-Record-Basics` (Monday)

First course on Active Record, this powerful ruby library to connect your object to the database. Active Record is one of the core modules in Rails. Discover how an ActiveRecord model is magically linked to a table thanks to a simple **naming convention**. That's Active Record magic!

## `04-Active-Record-Advanced` (Tuesday)

Let's go deeper into Active Record and speak of validations and associations.

### Quizz

At 2pm, third paper quizz of the program:

ðŸ‘‰ [Quizz #3](https://github.com/lewagon/quizzes/raw/master/pdf/quizz-3.en.pdf)

This one will take you up to 45 minutes and will be corrected publicly by the lead-teacher (for all the class at the same time and not in one-to-one reviews).
