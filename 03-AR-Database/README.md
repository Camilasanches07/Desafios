## DB & ActiveRecord module

The DB & ActiveRecord module has 4 days.

### `01-DB-Design-and-SQL` (Thursday)

Let's learn what is a relational database, what kind of relationships exist between tables and how we can literally **draw** a database scheme. Then, we'll speak of SQL, this language structured with keywords (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc..) to make queries to our DB. We will start with simple "read queries" (`SELECT`) during this first day.

### `02-SQL-CRUD` (Friday)
Second day of SQL. You'll discover the concept of CRUD, and you will learn to write in the DB with new SQL keywords (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

### `03-Active-Record-Basics` (Monday)
First class of Active Record, this awesome ruby library to make our object communicate with the DB. Active Record is one of the core modules of Rails. Discover how a AR model is magically linked to a table of the DB if you just respect Active Record **naming convention**. That's magic!

### `03-Active-Record-Basics` (Tuesday)
Let's go deeper into Active Record and speak of validations and associations.

#### Quizz
At 2pm, third and last paper quizz of the program:

- [Quizz in English](https://github.com/lewagon/quizzes/raw/gh-pages/pdf/3-db-english.pdf)
- [Quizz in French](https://github.com/lewagon/quizzes/raw/gh-pages/pdf/3-db-french.pdf)

This one will take you up to 45 minutes and will be corrected publicly by the lead-teacher (for all the class, not in one-to-one interviews like previous quizzes).
