Time to practise image upload with the `carrierwave` and `attachinary` gems with **Cloudinary**!

Today at 2pm, it's quizz time! Let's step back and rehearse all the core notions of Rails on a paper quizz. It should take you about 45 minutes. Take your time and go back to your cocktail app once you've finished. We will correct the quizz alltogether at the end of the day.
