## Background & Objectives

Now it's time to make a 3-model app! And you guessed it, we'll be introducing a many to
many relationship (`n:n`). So what's the deal? Well, it's time to build a cocktail
manager. We want to store our favourite cocktails, and their recipes.

## Rails app generation

**Note**: You should now be able to run these steps without this cheat sheet!

First let's create a new Rails app using PostgreSQL

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>
rails new rails-mister-cocktail -T --database=postgresql
cd rails-mister-cocktail
```

We then need to locally create the database for this new rails app.

```bash
rails db:create
```

Let's set up git, create a repo on GitHub and push our skeleton.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "rails new"
hub create
git push origin master
```

Let's import the teacher's spec to be able to `rake` our progress.

```bash
echo "gem 'rspec-rails', group: [ :test ]" >> Gemfile
echo "gem 'rails-controller-testing', group: [ :test ]" >> Gemfile
bundle install
rails db:test:prepare
git submodule add https://github.com/lewagon/fullstack-challenges-04-Rails-mister-cocktail-specs.git spec
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare rails app with external specs"
```

You'll be able to test your code with:

```bash
rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test  # If you added a migration
rake                            # Launch tests
```

## Heroku deployment

Follow [the lecture instructions](https://karr.lewagon.org/lectures/rails/04-hosting-deployment/#/1/12) about preparing your app for Heroku hosting.

Then, in your terminal, create the app...

```bash
heroku create mr-cocktail-<user.lower_github_nickname> --region eu
```

...and make your first deployment:

```bash
git push heroku master && heroku run rails db:migrate
```

## Style

Don't forget to use the [lewagon/stylesheets](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-stylesheets)
for your CSS architecture.

(Now `commit` and `deploy` this. You know the drill. **Continuous deployment!**)

## Specs

### Models

Go to [db.lewagon.com](http://db.lewagon.com) and draw the schema with your buddy. The tables
we need are `cocktails`, `ingredients` and `doses`.

Validate all models tests before moving to the routing layer. You can use this command:

```bash
rspec spec/models
```

to selectively run tests in the `spec/models` folder.

#### Attributes

- A **cocktail** has a name (e.g. `"Mint Julep"`, `"Whiskey Sour"`, `"Mojito"`)
- An **ingredient** has a name (e.g. `"lemon"`, `"ice"`, `"mint leaves"`)
- A **dose** is the amount needed for each ingredient in a cocktail (e.g. the Mojito cocktail needs **6cl** of lemon). So each dose references a cocktail, an ingredient and has a description.

#### Validation

- A cocktail must have a unique name.
- An ingredient must have a unique name.
- A dose must have a description, a cocktail and an ingredient, and [cocktail, ingredient] pairings should be unique.

#### Associations

- A cocktail has many doses
- A cocktail has many ingredients through doses
- An ingredient has many doses
- A dose belongs to an ingredient
- A dose belongs to a cocktail
- You can't delete an ingredient if it used by at least one cocktail.
- When you delete a cocktail, you should delete associated doses (but not the ingredients as they can be linked to other cocktails).

### Seed the ingredients üçã

**Our app will not allow users to create ingredients**.
Instead, we will generate a static seed of ingredients to choose from.
Write this seed, for example

```ruby
# db/seeds.rb
Ingredient.create(name: "lemon")
Ingredient.create(name: "ice")
Ingredient.create(name: "mint leaves")
```

**Optional**: have fun and seed real ingredients using [this JSON list](http://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/list.php?i=list) (with `open-uri` and `json` ruby libs).

### Routing

Once again, you must have a precise idea of the features of your app in order to build your routes. Here is the list of features:

- A user can see the list of cocktails

```
GET "cocktails"
```

- A user can see the details of a given cocktail, with the dose needed for each ingredient

```
GET "cocktails/42"
```

- A user can create a new cocktail

```
GET "cocktails/new"
POST "cocktails"
```

- A user can add a new dose (ingredient/description pair) to an existing cocktail

```
GET "cocktails/42/doses/new"
POST "cocktails/42/doses"
```

- A user can delete a dose that belongs to an existing cocktail

```
DELETE "doses/25"
```

Do we need an `IngredientsController`?

### Views

Now time to make a nice front-end! üòä

### Going further (Harder)

Try to put the "New dose form" on the cocktail page, not on a separate page.
