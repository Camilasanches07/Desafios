## Background & Objectives

We want to build a simple airbnb clone (like [this one](https://wagon-wikinimous.herokuapp.com)). These should be all the user stories of our app:

- As a user, I can post a flat to the website, specifying its name and address
- As a user, I can see all the available flats on our website
- As a user, I am able to see detailed information of a given flat, including a nice little map if I get lost ðŸ˜Š
- As a user, I am able to edit the details of a flat if I made a mistake
- As a user, I am able to delete a flat from the website, in case I don't want to rent it anymore

There is no `rake` here, and do not create your Rails app in `fullstack-challenges` â›”

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>
rails new rails-simple-airbnb
cd rails-simple-airbnb
git init
git add .
git commit -m "rails new"
hub create
git push origin master
```
