## 9 AM - 9:30 AM
Students' welcoming with pastries and coffee

## 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM

### Staff and basic rules (manager)
- Gather students in the classroom for the Kick-Off
- Introduce the team
- Spell out basic rules for the place

### Program philosophy (teacher)
1. Teacher's background
1. Computer science = boring. Le Wagon = different approach mixing hard and soft skills:
  - Product-oriented vision
  - Engineering
  - Design
  - UX
1. Technical accelerator focused on web development:
  - Tackle in 9 weeks what students learn in 2 years in "regular" CS degree (often in their last year)
  - At the end you'll be able to prototype any Web product

_Ask students who among them wants to be a developer, who wants to found a startup, who has no idea yet?_

### Calendar overview (teacher)

Project calendar on the screen to go through the program with the class.

_First 3 weeks_

- The first 3 weeks are **hard**. Only algo / software architecture
- The equivalent of an entire year in coding schools
- You will struggle, you may doubt, wonder where we're heading
- Just hold on, stay motivated and trust us: 600 former students have experienced the program
- It works, so at this point, **trust us** and fight for it!

#### Monday (Week 1) - Setup
- Special day, we'll focus on your machines setup, you'll go home with pimped workstations ready for the next 9 weeks!

#### Tuesday -> Friday (Week 1) - Ruby Core
- Ruby core program. Fundamentals. Elementary blocks. Scripts in 1 or 2 files, we'll run them in the terminal.
- Fast pace, a lot of information, you might feel on the verge of exploding

#### Monday -> Tuesday (Week 2) - Ruby ReBoot
- We'll split the class in two groups after the morning lecture.
- There will be a **reboot** group for those who want to have a second pass on the fundamentals

#### Wednesday (Week 2) -> Wednesday (Week 3) - Building Softwares
- When your program grows, you won't keep 2000 in one big file, it's impossible to maintain.
- Instead, you'll need to **organize** your code and split it in different files.
- That's what Software architecture is.
- Also very hard, you'll build entire software in two days, still in the terminal, **hang on :)**

#### Thursday (Week 3) -> Tuesday (Week 4) - Database
- Now that you know how to build software, you need to learn how to save **data**.
- Database, SQL, you'll find it easier, the pace slows down a little at this point.

#### Wednesday (Week 4) -> Thursday (Week 5) - Frontend
- What's missing now? A proper interface. We'll replace the terminal by a Web browser.
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, less painful, and more graphical, good way to express your creativity, fresh air for your minds.
- A couple of days on JavaScript at the end.
- At this time you'll have nice static websites online :)

#### Friday (Week 5) - Project Day
- No code
- Product day
- Pitch your idea
- Discuss, constitute 3-member (or 4-member) teams
- Convince other students to join your team, or join someone else's
- Focus on the **learning interest** of the project.
- After the bootcamp you can build 1, 2, 3, any Rails app. The 2 weeks is not the only opportunity to ship **your** idea.
- Team up with people you'll get along with!
- Choose **above all** a cool and interesting project (not a 10000th market place...). You are here to have fun and learn a maximum.

#### Monday - Friday (Week 6) ) Rails basics
- One Rails app a day!
- Assemble all the pieces of the puzzle.
- You'll get the big picture on why we learnt all those blocks.
- At this time you'll have real websites with a back-end deployed online.

#### Monday - Friday (Week 7) - Airbnb week
- Airbnb clone! (no flats allowed).
- Team up with your project buddies.
- Collaborate on Github.
- Make mistakes you won't make again during the Project's weeks :)

#### Monday (Week 8) - Friday (Week 9) - Project Weeks
- Projects!
- Same teams as Airbnb's week
- Make beautiful products!
- No marketplaces :)
- Enjoy yourselves!

### Typical week overview (teacher)
- We'll work everyday (from Monday to Friday), **including holidays**.
- _Paris_ yoga lessons with our yoga teacher **Claire** (let her introduce herself) on Wednesdays (4:30 - 5:30 PM) & Fridays (12 PM - 1 PM)
  - Yoga lessons are **strongly recommended** to relax from long hours focusing on your screens
  - You'll come back with a fresh and reloaded mind, and you'll be **more productive**!
  - Yoga and Code get along pretty well! :)
- _Paris_ apero-talks on Thursdays (7 PM) organized by our CM: **Edouard** (let him introduce himself and mention coming events)
  - **You** get to run the interview of a guest (CEOs, actors of the Tech scene, entrepreneurs...)
  - One "animator" sits next to our guest and leads the interview - prepare an agenda
  - Other students prepare questions
  - ~45 minutes "formal" interview
  - Informal, friendly talk around drinks

### Typical day overview (teacher)
- **9 AM - 10:30 AM**: Morning lecture in the classroom. Quite intense. Don't be late, the lecture starts at 9 AM **sharp**, with or without you!
- **10:30 AM - 5:30 PM**:
  - Fullstack-Challenges on Kitt (the exercises platform we'll show you later) with your buddy. Take enough time with your buddy to read the exercise's README from top to bottom, discuss it to be sure it's properly understood, and share ideas on how to complete the exercise before you start coding.
  - Usually everyone takes a lunch break around 1 PM, but you can take it whenever you want (Teaching Assistants often have lunch around 1 PM ;)
  - _Paris_ Introduce Le Wagon [tips](https://github.com/lewagon/tips/blob/master/paris.geojson) mention restaurants around
- **5:30 PM - 7 PM**: Livecode. You'll gather in the classroom with the teacher and we'll work together on a brand new exercise. You'll code from scratch, guided by the class and teacher, the idea is to have an interactive session where everyone's involved.
- **7:00 PM**:
  - You've reached the end of the day! Have a beer in the neighborhood, get to know each others!
  - Back home, don't code (your brains need to **rest**), but take a few minutes to read next day's lecture (you can also play flashcards, we'll show you later)

### Any question?

## 10:30 AM - 1 PM: Setup

### Setup lecture (teacher)

Run the first Karr lecture on [Setup and Tools](https://karr.lewagon.org/lectures/setup/1-setup/)

### Setup session (students)

At the end of the lecture:
- Tell all students to start [Le Wagon's setup](https://github.com/lewagon/setup)
- Students on Mac should click on the apple, Linux on the penguin
- Students on Linux should gather with a dedicated teacher
- If you struggle on Linux setup: first read [WINDOWS.md](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/WINDOWS.md) and [UBUNTU_ISSUES.md](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/UBUNTU_ISSUES.md).

### Student validation (manager)

At the end of the setup, students will signin on [alumni.lewagon.org](http://alumni.lewagon.org) and complete their profile. Then:

- Manager should approve them on the city admin page (see for instance [Paris page](http://alumni.lewagon.org/cities/paris) to validate students' onboarding.
- Manager should **check that students belong to their batch before approving them**. Sometimes, several cities start the same day, and students may choose the worng batch.
- After this validation, they will receive 2 mails to join Le Wagon on Github and on Slack.

### 1 PM - 2 PM: Lunch time
- Tell students to be back at 2 PM sharp for the first (short) lectures

## 2 PM - 3 PM

### Terminal & Git (teacher)

- Introduce Karr (lecture platform) now that they have access to it.
- Start with [terminal lecture](https://karr.lewagon.org/lectures/setup/2-terminal-101/#/)
- Then continue with [git and Github lecture](https://karr.lewagon.org/lectures/setup/3-git-101/#/)
- At the end of the git and Github lecture, make a **demo of Kitt** and how to submit solution to challenges:
  1. Navigation
  2. Lectures
  3. Videos
  4. Classmates
  5. Buddies
  6. Exercises (Solving the demo exercise 00-Setup/00-Demo)
  7. Tickets
  8. Flashcards

## 3 PM - End of the day
- Students should finish their setup
- They should complete Kitt's first challenge
- They can go home when it's done!
- They should be in the classroom ready for the first lecture next morning at 9 AM sharp!
