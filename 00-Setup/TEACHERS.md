## 9 AM - 9:30 AM
Students' welcoming with pastries and coffee

## 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM
### Intro
**City's driver**

- Gather students in the classroom for the Kick-Off
- Introduce the team
- Spell out basic rules for the place

**Lead teacher(s)**

- Teacher's background
- Computer science not sexy at school, very unpopular
- Here, very different approach mixing many skills and not only "hard" technical computer science skills
  - Product-oriented vision
  - Engineering
  - Design
  - UX

- Technical accelerator
- Focus on Web development
- Tackle in 9 weeks what students learn in a complete year in "regular" coding schools (often in their last year)
- At the end you'll be able to prototype any Web product

_Ask students who among them wants to be a developer, who wants to found a startup, who has no idea yet?_

### Calendar

_First 3 weeks_

- The first 3 weeks are **hard**. Only algo / software architecture.
- The equivalent of an entire year in coding schools.

#### Monday (Week 1)
- Special day, we'll focus on your machines setup, you'll go home with pimped workstations ready for the next 9 weeks!

#### Tuesday -> Friday (Week 1)
- Ruby core program. Fundamentals. Elementary blocks. Scripts in 1 or 2 files, we'll run them in the terminal.
- Fast pace, a lot of information, you might feel on the verge of exploding

#### Monday -> Tuesday (Week 2)
- We'll split the class in two groups after the morning lecture.
- There will be a **reboot** group for those who want to have a second pass on the fundamentals

#### Wednesday (Week 2) -> Wednesday (Week 3)
- When your program grows, you won't keep 2000 lines in 1 or 2 files, you'll need to **organize** your code
- Software architecture
- Also very hard, you'll build entire software in two days, still in the terminal, **hang on :)**

_Database_

#### Thursday (Week 3) -> Tuesday (Week 4)
- Now that you know how to build software, you need to learn how to save **data**
- Database, SQL, you'll find it easier, the pace slows down a little at this point

_Front-End_

#### Wednesday (Week 4) -> Thursday (Week 5)
- What's missing now? A proper interface. We'll replace the terminal by a Web browser
- Front-end: HTML and CSS, less painful, good way to express your creativity, fresh air for your minds
- A couple of days on JavaScript at the end

#### Friday (Week 5)
- No code
- Product day
- Pitch your idea
- Discuss, constitute 3-member (or 4-member) teams
- Convince other students to join your team, or join someone else's
- Focus on the **learning interest** and not the personal illusion to save time
- Team up with people you'll get along with!

_Two weeks of Rails_

#### Monday - Friday (Week 6)
- One Rails app a day!
- Assemble all the pieces of the puzzle
- You'll get a better idea of why we learnt all those blocks
- At this time you'll have real websites with a back-end deployed online

#### Monday - Friday (Week 7)
- Airbnb clone! (no flats allowed)
- Team up with your project buddies
- Collaborate on Github
- Make mistakes you won't make again during the Project's weeks :)

_Two weeks on your Projects_

#### Monday (Week 8) - Friday (Week 9)
- Projects!
- Same teams as Airbnb's week
- Make beautiful products!
- No marketplaces :)
- Enjoy yourselves!

### Typical week
- We'll work everyday (from Monday to Friday), **including holidays**.
- _Paris_ yoga lessons with our yoga teacher **Claire** (let her introduce herself) on Wednesdays (4:30 - 5:30 PM) & Fridays (12 PM - 1 PM)
  - Yoga lessons are **strongly recommended** to relax from long hours focusing on your screens
  - You'll come back with a fresh and reloaded mind, and you'll be **more productive**!
  - Yoga and Code get along pretty well! :)
- _Paris_ apero-talks on Thursdays (7 PM) organized by our CM: **Edouard** (let him introduce himself)
  - **You** get to run the interview of a guest (CEOs, actors of the Tech scene, entrepreneurs...)
  - One "animator" sits next to our guest and leads the interview - prepare an agenda
  - Other students prepare questions
  - ~45 minutes "formal" interview
  - Informal, friendly talk around drinks

### Typical day
- **9 AM - 10:30 AM**: Morning lecture in the classroom. Quite intense. Don't be late, the lecture starts at 9 AM **sharp**, with our without you!
- **10:30 AM - 5:30 PM**:
  - Fullstack-Challenges on Kitt (the exercises platform we'll show you later) with your buddy. Take enough time with your buddy to read the questions from top to bottom, discuss it to be sure it's properly understood, and share ideas on how to complete the exercise before you start coding.
  - Usually everyone takes a lunch break around 1 PM, but you can take it when you want
  - _Paris_ Introduce Le Wagon [tips](https://github.com/lewagon/tips/blob/master/paris.geojson) show them restaurants around
- **5:30 PM - 7 PM**: Livecode. You'll gather in the classroom with the teacher and we'll work together on a brand new exercise. You'll code from scratch, guided by the class, the idea is to have an interactive session where everyone participates.
- **7:00 PM**:
  - You reached the end of the day! Have a beer in the neighborhood, get to know each others!
  - Back home, don't code (your brains need to **rest**), but take a few minutes to read next day's lecture (you can also play flashcards, we'll show you later)

### Any question?

### First lecture: Setup your computer
- Go to the lectures' [summary](/00-Setup/README.md) and show briefly how Karr works

## 10:30 AM - ~ 1 PM
- At the end of the lecture:
  - students can begin their computer's setups
  - students on Mac should click on the apple, Linux on the penguin
  - students on Linux should gather with a teacher
  - Useful resources for Linux setups: [WINDOWS.md](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/WINDOWS.md) and [UBUNTU_ISSUES.md](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/UBUNTU_ISSUES.md).

- Manager: often refresh [city admin page](http://alumni.lewagon.org/cities/:city_slug) to validate students' onboarding.

### Lunch time

## 2 PM - 3 PM
### Terminal & Git
- Karr slides
- Kitt demo:
  1. Navigation
  2. Lectures
  3. Videos
  4. Classmates
  5. Buddies
  6. Exercises (Solving the new exercise 00-Setup/00-Demo)
  7. Tickets
  8. Flashcards

## 3 PM - End of the day
- Students should finish their setup
- They should complete Kitt's first challenge
- They can go home when it's done!
- They should be in the classroom ready for the first lecture next morning at 9 AM sharp!
