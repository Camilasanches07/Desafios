## 9 AM - 9:30 AM
Students' welcoming with pastries and coffee

## 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM
### Intro
- Gather students in the classroom to present the program
- Introduce the team
- Spell out basic rules for the place

- Teacher's background
- Computer science not sexy at school, very unpopular
- Very different approach mixing many skills and not only 'hard' technical computer science skills
  - Product-oriented vision
  - Engineering
  - Design
  - UX

- Technical accelerator
- Focus on Web development
- See in 9 weeks what students learn in a complete year in classical coding schools (often in their last year)
- At the end you'll be able to prototype any Web product

_Ask students who among them wants to be a developer, who wants to found a startup, who has no idea yet?_

### Calendar
- The first 3 weeks are **hard**. Only algo / software architecture.
- The equivalent of an entire year in coding schools.

#### Monday (Week 1)
- Special day, we'll focus on your machines setup, you'll go home with pimped workstations ready for the next 9 weeks!

#### Tuesday -> Friday (Week 1)
- Ruby core program. Fundamentals. Elementary blocks. Scripts in 1 or 2 files, we'll run them in the terminal.
- Fast pace, a lot of information, you might feel on the verge of exploding

#### Monday -> Tuesday (Week 2)
- We'll split the class in two groups after the morning lecture.
- There will be a **reboot** group for those who want to have a second pass on the fundamentals

#### Wednesday (Week 2) -> Wednesday (Week 3)
- When your program grows, you wont keep 2000 lines in 1 or 2 files, you'll need to **organize** your code
- Software architecture
- Also very hard, you'll build entire software in two days, still in the terminal, **hang on :)**

#### Thursday (Week 3) -> Tuesday (Week 4)
- Now that you know how to build software, you need to learn how to save **data**
- Database, SQL, you'll find it easier, the pace slows down a little at this point

#### Wednesday (Week 4) -> Thursday (Week 5)
- What's missing at this point? A proper interface. We'll replace the terminal by a Web browser
- Front-end: HTML and CSS, less painful, good way to express your creativity, fresh air for your minds
- A couple of days on JavaScript at the end

#### Friday (Week 5)
- No code
- Product day
- Pitch your idea
- Discuss, constitute 3-member (or 4-member) teams
- Convince other students to join your team or join someone else's
- Focus on the **learning interest** and not the personal illusion to save time
