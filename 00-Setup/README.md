## Roadmap of the day

Let's set up your workstation

- Go through 1st setup lecture with your lead-coad then follow [Le Wagon's setup carefully](https://github.com/lewagon/setup). It should take you all morning, maybe a bit more for non-Mac students ;)

- Once the setup is done, go through lectures #2 and #3 with lead-coach to learn command line basics (navigate in filesystem, create directories & files, launch Sublime Text) + basic git commands (`add`/`commit`/`push`). You'll need to know these commands to submit solutions to our 9-week challenges.

- You can finally login to Kitt and get approved by the staff. Once, that's done, follow the instuction to correctly fork the challenges repo.

- Time to push your solution to the first two challenges `01-Submit-your-code` and `02-Buddies`. These challenges are simply sanity checks to ensure you have correctly forked the exercise repo. No real ruby code here. Serious things begin tomorrow, be prepared!

You now have all the tools you need to successfully work your way through the bootcamp during these 9 weeks. Remember, your new toolbox is:

- **Sublime Text**, where you'll write Ruby code (and more!)
- The **Terminal**, also called a shell, where you'll type commands. When you see a `$` in the exercises, it means that you'll have to type that command
- **git**, the version control tool you'll use to watch your code, snapshot, and thus submit your attempts to Kitt!

Glad you are here! Let's rock it!
