## Setup (Monday)

Let's set up your workstation:

1. **10:15am**: Go through a 15 min first lecture with your teacher about the tools you need to install as a developer.

2. **10:30am-1pm**: Follow [Le Wagon's setup carefully](https://github.com/lewagon/setup) and ask help whenever you are stuck. It should take you all morning, maybe overlap a bit on your lunch break for non-Mac users ðŸ˜‰.

3. **2pm-2:15pm**: Second 15 min lecture on command line basics (navigate in filesystem, create directories & files, launch Sublime Text from terminal, etc...)

4. **2:15pm-3pm**: Third 45 min lecture on git commands (`add`/`commit`/`push`).

5. **3pm-3:15pm**: At the end of the git lecture, your teacher will show you the Kitt platform (challenges, tickets, flashcards) and how to push a solution on a demo challenge `00-Setup/00-Demo` (first challenge that teacher should solve and push with the class).
.

6. **3:15pm-5pm**: Time to push your attempt to the first challenge `01-Submit-your-code` of the bootcamp. This challenge is just a sanity check to ensure you have correctly forked the exercise repo. No real code here, serious things begin tomorrow. Be prepared!

You now have all the tools you need to successfully work your way through the bootcamp during these 9 weeks. Remember, your new toolbox is:

- **Sublime Text**, where you'll write Ruby code (and more!)
- The **Terminal**, also called a shell, where you'll type commands.
- **git**, the version control tool you'll use to watch your code, snapshot, and thus submit your attempts to Kitt!

Glad you are here! Let's rock it ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€!
