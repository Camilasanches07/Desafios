## Setup (Monday)

Let's set up your workstation

1. Go through 1st lecture with your lead-coad then follow [Le Wagon's setup carefully](https://github.com/lewagon/setup). It should take you all morning, maybe a bit more for non-Mac students ;)

2. Once the setup is done, go through lectures #2 and #3 with lead-coach to learn command line basics (navigate in filesystem, create directories & files, launch Sublime Text) + basic git commands (`add`/`commit`/`push`). You'll need to know these commands to submit attempts to our challenges.

3. You can finally login to [kitt](http://kitt.lewagon.org) and wait for staff approval. Once that's done, follow kitt instuctions to correctly fork the exercise repo.

4. Time to push your attempt to the first challenge `01-Submit-your-code`. This challenge is just a sanity check to ensure you have correctly forked the exercise repo. No real code here, serious things begin tomorrow. Be prepared!

You now have all the tools you need to successfully work your way through the bootcamp during these 9 weeks. Remember, your new toolbox is:

- **Sublime Text**, where you'll write Ruby code (and more!)
- The **Terminal**, also called a shell, where you'll type commands. When you see a `$` in the exercises, it means that you'll have to type that command in the terminal.
- **git**, the version control tool you'll use to watch your code, snapshot, and thus submit your attempts to Kitt!

Glad you are here! Let's rock it!
