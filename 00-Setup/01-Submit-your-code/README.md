## Background & Objectives

* Understand the structure of an exercise's repo, and the link to your Github account.
* Learn to test your code locally before submitting your solution.
* Learn the basic git commands to commit modifications to your code and push them to Github.
* Discover the features of the Kitt platform.

During these 9 weeks, you'll work in pairs or groups of 3-4. Everyday, a new buddy is assigned to you, following an algorithm of [round robin tournament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament) implemented in this [gem](https://github.com/ssaunier/round_robin_tournament).

Before starting a new challenge, **make sure that you explain to each other what you've understood of it** and **before** starting to write a single line of code. Then you can pair program, or work side by side, checking up every 10 minutes or so to help one another.

Working in pairs is a common practice of Software Engineering. The idea is that if you work alone and you get stuck, you can loose several hours digging in the issue, whereas a fresh pair of eyes would find the problem within seconds. Don't underestimate that!

## Specs

### First exercise

Open the `lib/wagon_start.rb` file. That's where you'll need to edit

* Make the `wagon_start` method return `'That's how it starts'`
* In the terminal, run `rake` and make sure if you're 100% green + have a good style.
* Commit your changes, and push them.
* Come back to Kitt, and refresh the page. You should see your solution on the right

### Second Exercise

Open the `lib/buddy.rb`. Make sure that the method `today_my_buddys_github_nickname_is` does **return** (which is different than **puts**!) the github username of your buddy. If you don't have any buddy, just return your own github username.

When you're done you can look at the links below.
