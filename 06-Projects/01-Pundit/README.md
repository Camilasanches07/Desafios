## Projects - Day One

You should now belong to a team of 3 to 4 people, with a clear concept for the MVP you're going
to be building for the next 2 weeks. The goal of the day is the same as Airbnb - Day 1:

- Write **user stories** down. You should have no more than 15. Duplicate this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_q-wwWiWUY5VL0gZVtqWIidWEtfwhX8FHEbwaW0LuFI/edit?usp=sharing) (1 per team) and invite your teammates to collaborate.
- Open [db.lewagon.com](http://db.lewagon.com) and figure out the **database schema**
- Open your figma from the Product Design Sprint and make sure it still matches the demo you have in mind for Demoday!
- From the mock-ups, figure out the **routes** and add them to your spreadsheet

For **each step**, ask a teacher to validate it. Rushing straight into the code is the best way to waste time writing code that you won't use!

When starting your rails app, you **must** use one of the [**Wagon Rails Templates**](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates/tree/rails-six). Make sure you use the [Devise template](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates/tree/rails-six#devise) if you need users!
