As not everyone will be able to code the app setup, now is the perfect time to divide up the rest of the steps amongst your team so that everyone has something to work on.


### Rails New
First, decide amongst your team who will be the Lead Developer for this project. This can be the same person from your Airbnb project, or a new team member can give it a go. That person will then continue with the following steps for setting up the app.

When starting your rails project, you **must** use one of the [**Wagon Rails Templates**](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates/tree/master). Make sure you use the [Devise template](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates/tree/master#devise) if you need a `User` model!

After the app is created, create your Github Repository and add all teammates as collaborators. Check out the [Github lecture slides](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/lectures/05-Rails%2F06-Airbnb-Devise#/1/3/0) for an overview of the process.

Then create the Heroku app and do your initial deploy. Check out [the Heroku lecture slides](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/lectures/05-Rails%2F05-Rails-MC-with-images#/0/2/5) if you need a refresher on the steps.

Tip: always run `heroku run rails db:migrate` after pushing to Heroku to make sure your production database is up to date with any changes.



### Figma
As you likely found out during Airbnb Week, having a thorough and fully fleshed-out Figma can make a world of a difference for your team's working process. Knowing exactly what each feature should look like, with a consistent design pattern, is what takes your app to the next level!

While you created your initial mockup on the Product Design Sprint, now is the time to take another look and update it based on the decisions you & your team made earlier about user stories, routes, etc.
Figma is an incredible tool with loads of cool features that you can utilize here to make a high-fidelity prototype. Make sure to create your [components library](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-Components-in-Figma), add some plugins like [unsplash](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/738454987945972471/Unsplash), [color palettes](https://www.figma.com/community/search?model_type=public_plugins&q=color%20palettes) and explore even more in the [community](https://www.figma.com/community/explore) section.

Choose a team member to work on improving the Figma while the others continue with the next tasks.
