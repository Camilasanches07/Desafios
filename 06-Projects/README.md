## Projects

We are now entering the two last weeks of the program. It's your turn to shine. Time flies, so make sure you release often in production and have a nice front-end
as soon as possible! Good luck, here are your milestones:

- First week, Friday 5pm: first demo to get class/staff feedbacks and organize your roadmap for the second week.
- Second week Thursday (7pm): rehearsal for final demo.
- Second week Friday (6pm): the big day. Every one is here! Press, VCs, your family! Kick it!

**Le Wagon Rails Templates**: to save time on all boring configurations of last week, you can use one of the [**Wagon Rails Templates**](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates). It'll get you up and running faster.

## Morning lectures

During these two weeks, **no live-code at 5pm**. You will still have morning talks on advanced topics. Here is the program for morning lectures.

### `01-Pundit` (Monday)

Handle authorizations using the [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) gem. This library makes you isolate the "authorization logic" in `Policy` objects in order not to pollute the code of your controllers.

### `02-i18n` (Tuesday)

How about having an international app handling different languages? That is what Internationalization (`I..18 characters..n"`) is about.

### `03-Advanced-Admin`(Wednesday)

Learn to customize your administration dashboards using either [ActiveAdmin](http://activeadmin.info/) or [Rails Admin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin).

### `04-Background-jobs` (Thursday)

Push outside of the controller time-consuming processes (delivering emails, posting to an API, cleaning up, etc.) using [Active Job](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html).

### `05-Build-an-API` (Friday)

Learn the best practices to build an API with Rails.

### `06-Payment-with-Stripe` (Monday)

Add payment to your apps using [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

### `07-Search` (Tuesday)

Implement a search, either manually or by using [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).
