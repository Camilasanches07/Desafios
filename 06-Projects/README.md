## Projects

We are now entering the two last weeks of the program. It's your time to shine. Time is going to really fly, so make sure you are deploying in production as often as you can, and **don't neglect your front-end**! Remember, the look of your site will be the first thing people see on Demo Day.

Good luck - you're going to be amazing. Here are your milestones:

- First week, Friday 5pm: first demo to get class / staff feedback and organize your roadmap for the second week.
- Second week Thursday (7pm): rehearsal for final demo.
- Second week Friday (6pm): THE BIG DAY. Everyone is here! Press, VCs, your family! Smash it!

**Le Wagon Rails Templates**: to save time on all the boring configurations of last week, you can use one of the [**Wagon Rails Templates**](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates). It'll get you up and running faster.

## Morning lectures

During these two weeks, **there is no afternoon live-code**. You will still have morning talks on advanced topics though. Here is the program for morning lectures:

### `01 Authorization with Pundit`

Handle authorizations using the [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) gem. This library isolates the "authorization logic" in `Policy` objects to stop you polluting your controllers with extra code.

### `02 i18n`

How about having an international app to handle different languages? That is what Internationalization (`I + 18 characters + n"` = `i18n`) is about.

### `03 Admin Interfaces`

Learn to customize your admin dashboards using either [ActiveAdmin](http://activeadmin.info/) or [Rails Admin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin).

### `04 Background Jobs with Sidekiq`

Take time-consuming processes (delivering emails, posting to an API, cleaning up, etc.) out of the controller using [Active Job](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html).

### `05 Build an API with Rails`

Learn how to build an API with Rails.

### `06 Payment with Stripe`

Add payment to your apps using [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

### `07 Search`

Implement a search, either manually or by using [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).

### `08 Testing`

What are tests and how can they be used to drive development and make sure other developers don't break your code?
