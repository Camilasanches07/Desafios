## Projects

We are now entering the two last weeks of the program. It's your turn to shine. Time flies, so make sure you release often in production and have a nice front-end
as soon as possible! Good luck, see you at Demo Day :) Here are your Milestones:

- Friday first week (5pm): first demo to get feedbacks and organize second week roadmap.
- Thursday second week (7pm): rehearsal for final demo.
- Friday second week (5pm): the big day. Every one is here! Press, VCs, your family! Kick it!

**Le Wagon Rails Templates**: to save time on all boring configurations of last week, you can use one of the [**Wagon Rails Templates**](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates). It'll get you up and running faster.

## Morning lectures

During the two project-weeks, **no live-code at 5pm** but you'll still have morning talks on advanced topics. Here is the program for morning lectures.

### `01-Pundit` (Monday)
Handle authorizations in your Rails app using the [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) gem. It make you isolate authorization logic in `Policy` objects so that you don't pollute your controllers code.

### `02-i18n` (Tuesday)
How about having an international app handling different languages. That is what Internationalization (`I#{18 characters}n`) is about.

### `03-Advanced-Admin`(Wednesday)
Learn to customize your administration dashboards, using either [ActiveAdmin](http://activeadmin.info/) or [Rails Admin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin).

### `04-Background-jobs` (Thursday)
Push outside of the controller time-consuming processes (delivering emails, posting to an API, cleaning up, etc.) using [Active Job](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html)

### `05-Build-an-API` (Friday)
Learn the best practices to build an API with Rails.

### `06-Payment-with-Stripe` (Monday)
Add payment to your apps using [Stripe](https://stripe.com).
