## Projects - Day One

You should now belong to a team of 2 to 4 people, with an idea of the MVP you're going
to build for the next 2 weeks. The goal of the day is the same as Airbnb - Day 1:

1. Write user stories down. You should have no more than 15. You can use [Trello](http://trello.com)
1. Open [db.lewagon.org](http://db.lewagon.org) and figure out the database schema
1. Draw mock-ups of **every** screen your app needs. Draw arrows between them to show how your user navigate to get the **unique value proposition** out of your app.

For **each step**, ask a teacher to validate it. Do not rush into code!

When starting your rails app, you can use one of the [**Wagon Rails Templates**](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates). It'll get you up and running faster.
